- [April 25, 2021, 3:07 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1386215271027732481/): This is great Quoted gothspiderbitch&#x27;s tweet: so did anyone else know that there was a massive pool noodle battle planned between all the people named Josh today that was ultimately won by a 5-year old named Josh who was crowned The Supreme Josh or was I just supposed to find this out on my own
- [April 25, 2021, 1:36 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1386011173275922433/): It&#x27;s actually amazing how computers have become exponentially more powerful in my lifetime (yet somehow our web browsers manage to eat up most of the memory) Quoted ChefJags&#x27;s tweet: You can only retweet this if you know exactly how it feels to have this rig. Your browser does not support the video tag.

Not with time, as they say, but with intention. So go. Love intentionally, extravagantly, unconditionally. The broken world waits in darkness for the light that is you.&quot;-- L. R. Knost
- [April 22, 2021, 9:29 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1385224243848179719/): &quot;I&#x27;ll eat you!&quot; #sketchdaily 111/365 I originally drew this on my tiny pad then scanned it so the text could be readable, but my handwriting was so obviously bad in the scan, I edited a new (and different) line into the text bubble digitally. I&#x27;ll attach the original anyway so you can see how terrible my handwriting was. I&#x27;d say it was because the pad was so small, but really my handwriting is terrible at any size!
