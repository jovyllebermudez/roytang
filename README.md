The 7-x remains elusive. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhdwyrJV0VI (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Feb. 12, 2022, 7:08 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/02/1492455575069900805/): Streaming some Neon Dynasty limited! ep2 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy [23:48] #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgneo Did two drafts today. They were better than yesterday, but we still didn&#x27;t get to 7. =/ YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFJ92xM2ufI (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Feb. 12, 2022, 6:26 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/02/1492444974561914882/): I think one of the questions to ask in this sort of convo is &quot;ayaw mo ba malaman ang katotohanan?&quot; If they say they don&#x27;t care about the truth, you know who they are and convo is done. If they say otherwise, you are free to try to convince them. Quoted theninaellaine&#x27;s tweet: In today&#x27;s episode: &quot;Hindi lahat ng facts ay totoo.&quot; (Click photos to view full-size) [18:31] Of course, this means that we too must be willing to chase down the truth - show an openness to changing your own mind about the &quot;facts&quot; if evidence can be shown
