- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:18 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576909576313528320/): Managed to hit Master rank in Throne on @EternalCardGame last month, and even tried to go for rank 1, but my deck got nerfed towards the end of the month lol. I think I got to 14 at best and ended at 25. Too bad they don&#x27;t seem to be publishing the eom leaderboards anymore. (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:07 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576906681661161474/): The only thing this would expose would be a lack of understanding of how most people don&#x27;t actually choose lotto numbers randomly. Quoted gmanews&#x27;s tweet: Senate Minority Leader Aquilino &quot;Koko&quot; Pimentel III on Sunday said he would file a resolution seeking an investigation into how 433 bettors won the P236 million PCSO Grand Lotto jackpot. https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/846706/pimentel-to-seek-senate-probe-on-433-bettors-winning-the-pcso-grand-lotto/story/
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 7:55 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576903743593140225/): I think I do. Can I give it a shot? It has to do with the purpose of government. For some people (like us) purpose of government is to help people. We think fairness is possible, and that the government&#x27;s job is to try to create fairness. Others have a different worldview. 1/ https://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1556372038008332290
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 7:55 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576903714920890368/): Contrary to popular belief, most DLC isn’t content that was maliciously cut from the game to make an extra buck. DLC has its own budget, timelines, greenlight, staff, etc. It’s a whoooole separate project. And nowadays it’s necessary for a AAA/AAAA game to ever break even. https://twitter.com/PushDustIn/status/1537598685625737216
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 7:55 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576903661250580483/): Very long set of threads about the the various revisions Tolkien made to LOTR. The initial draft was a far, far cry from the finak outcome! Quoted mytholder&#x27;s tweet: So, for various reasons, I&#x27;m rereading the HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH books about the writing of Lord of the Rings. They&#x27;re fascinating (for certain values of fascinating); what I&#x27;m going to do this time try to extract writing advice (thread)
