- [Feb. 25, 2021, 6:28 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gomwdig/): It wasn&#x27;t a one-off night of no matches found that prompted me to post, this has been the general case for me for about the past two years/seasons, I think. I&#x27;m occasionally able to fight a match, but most of the time it takes me a long time to look for one, then I just give up out of frustration. I didn&#x27;t have much time last night, but I did actually manage to fight *one* guy (well, best of 3). Took me ten minutes to find that match, and after playing our 3 matches, I tried waiting another 10 minutes

- [Feb. 24, 2021, 10:22 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gol1nto/): Unfortunately, I lent out my PS4 copy a while back and can&#x27;t get it back easily now due to some kind of pandemic lol. Also, most of my unlocked last DLC from the last 2 seasons is on Steam now. Would streaming (Netflix, Youtube, etc) interfere with the matching? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m the only one who&#x27;d be doing large downloads in the household, so I can certainly avoid that, but other people are almost always streaming video when I&#x27;d want to be playing.
