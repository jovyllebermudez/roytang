I like that they understand that a lot of patients (esp. elderly ones) might not be tech-savvy, although I&#x27;m not sure what changes in the backend depending on this choice.

The film defies expectations at almost every turn, going in directions I never expected. It feels like to explain the film would be to ruin it, so I won&#x27;t. It is pretty good, and we get a serious Cage performance in this one.

It&#x27;s a comedy, but not a laugh-out-loud funny one, more wit than laugh track, though Steve Martin does put in some physical comedy at some point. It was ok, reasonably clever, but also a bit predictable. True crime fans might enjoy it more. Not sure if I&#x27;d watch the next season.
