- [Oct. 24, 2020, 12:15 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/10/1319794495395745793/): Despite not having played Eternal since before the pandemic, after reading this tweet from LSV, I signed up for the event he described and got the 7 wins and qualified for the LCQ in the first try. I used Skelle&#x27;s decklist from here: https://direwolfdigital.com/news/throne-summer-championship-decklists/ I&#x27;m having fun! Quoted lsv&#x27;s tweet: This is the perfect time to get into Eternal - you can try any deck you want, you&#x27;ve got a high-stakes tournament to play in, and there are lots of resources in the article for decklists, strategy guides, and more. I&#x27;m really hype about this, and would love to see

- [Oct. 23, 2020, 1:14 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/10/1319628147726270467/): Unlikely, as long as their fanbase remains rabid. Here in the Philippines, Marcos&#x27; children have risen the ranks in local politics unrepentant of and despite their father&#x27;s infamy, on the back of patronage and propaganda Quoted JessicaValenti&#x27;s tweet: One day Ivanka will try to separate herself from her father in an attempt to reenter polite society. There will be a tearful confession, a book deal, or a glossy PR campaign. We can never let that bullshit be successful https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1319476405080645634
- [Oct. 23, 2020, 10:44 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/10/g9qvnxs/): The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.
