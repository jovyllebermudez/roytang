The two drafts finished with 3 wins and 6 wins respectively. Would&#x27;ve preferred a second trophy, but I&#x27;ll take it!Unfortunately the stream was lagging again this time and YT exports are incomplete.Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L8WGxn3ppUPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IODASak6Kgw (Click photos to view full-size)

I didn&#x27;t help a lot with this one after the initial framing.
