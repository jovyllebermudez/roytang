Daniel Radcliffe&quot; by Glerren ðŸ¤“ - 3pts &quot;We&#x27;re All in This Together&quot; by PJCðŸ’¡- 9pts (x2 for joker) &quot;To the Moon and Back&quot; by Moon Rabbit ðŸŒ™ - 5pts &quot;BGM (Bidyo Game Mixtape)&quot; by Earle ðŸŽ¶ - 0pts (luckily we chose not to joker here lol) &quot;It&#x27;s Art!&quot; by Caroline ðŸŽ¨ - 6pts &quot;Trese&quot; by Dant - 5pts We counted 36pts for us, but they initially announced as at 35pts (first and second were at 36 and 37 respectively) which meant we had to contest, which
- [July 17, 2023, 11:10 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/07/110730061909275461/): Every so often I&#x27;ll read something about how blogs/RSS are dead, but every time I try to go through my backlog of things I&#x27;ve saved and blogs to check out I end up finding even more links and blogs to add to the list and I&#x27;m always worried that my feed reader has too many blogs on there so :shrug:
- [July 13, 2023, 5:51 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/07/110703324373892329/): Sadly a no internet morning for me as #globe fiber has been down since midnight. Already reported, lets see how good their response time is. Also yesterday we lost electricity for most of the morning so the week is going great lol
- [July 12, 2023, 9:39 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/07/110701390914256286/): I wasn&#x27;t able to take a screenshot, but letterboxd has a cool little easter egg if you submit a review for Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, took me by surprise! #movies
- [July 12, 2023, 9:38 p.m. Movies: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/07/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-2023/): Each Mission Impossible seems to have a signature stunt/scene to remember it by, like the hanging from the ceiling bit in the first film or climbing the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol. This one for sure will be remembered by the bike jump off the cliff; it&#x27;s only too bad it was heavily promoted in trailers and previews, so there is little to no surprise when he actually does it in the film.I liked the set pieces in Rome and the final train sequence (though it reminds me of a certain Playstation game.) Venice felt weak. The rest was okay.Decent
