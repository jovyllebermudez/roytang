- [19 Aug 2020 9:32am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1296017132891910147/): Wednesday afternoon Amonkhet Remastered draft (ep6) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgakr
- [18 Aug 2020 9:20am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1295651697302405120/): Tuesday afternoon Amonkhet Remastered draft (ep5) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgakr
The draft wasn&rsquo;t as good as the last one, but we still broke even. I wasn&rsquo;t too dumb this time, but I did sneeze out some luck. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2QNniqY6fc
- [18 Aug 2020 8:49am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/2d7fcd44f8a65f2078142cce92aa6b9a/): I wont stop upgrading to new beta versions of ios until they figure out how to stop killing my background processes from 10 seconds ago
- [17 Aug 2020 11:10am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1295317142502608897/): Monday evening Amonkhet Remastered draft (ep4) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgakr
Draft was good, but I was too dumb to get to 7 wins D: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcI0CRqRlwM
- [16 Aug 2020 2:04pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1294998594081021955/): Twitter should consider just showing the person’s bio when you reply to a tweet, to help avoid dumbass moments like this.
Quoted DanSlott&#39;s tweet:   There are definitely times when I should step away from Twitter for a bit&hellip; like&hellip; right&hellip; NOW.
All right, back to my script.
See ya later.
