- [Jan. 26, 2022, 8:42 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/01/playstation-wrapup-2021/): This was probably the worst of the wrap-ups from the past year. arrived late page didn&#x27;t even work for me at first, had to try again after a week or so design is terrible, lot of wasted space includes global stats, when this is My Wrapup! Have a separate page for that! I was however amused that my second most played game was the Tales of Arise demo, which I didn&#x27;t even play for more than an hour lol Related: My Switch Year in Review
