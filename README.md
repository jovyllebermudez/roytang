- [Feb. 22, 2021, 3:09 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363747640391860225/): For some reason, I watched Space Sweepers, a Korean sci-fi movie on Netflix. Fun ride, fairly entertaining, pretty good setpieces and special effects. (They are so far ahead of the local film industry.) Plot a bit predictable. Villain made no sense.
