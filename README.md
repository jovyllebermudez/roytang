- [Aug. 10, 2021, 4:01 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/08/1425004461445971976/): And even if it does all end, even if civilisation crumbles, even if we are the last ever generation of humans to walk this earth, let&#x27;s not waste our precious last few decades on doom and defeatism. Let&#x27;s hold onto out hope, our humanity and our very real power to make change.

- [Aug. 9, 2021, 1:17 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/08/1424600789809463299/): I thought I was done with #mtgafr, limited but in the wee hours of the morning earlier I threw some gems away on the draft challenge. RW pile went 0-2 (boo!), UR went 4-2 (better, but still not happy with it). I should stop letting the format keep drawing me back in lol
