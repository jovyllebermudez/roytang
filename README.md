- [Nov. 11, 2022, 1:58 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/1590946971715792896/): @mikafabs I think I was at this quiz night because I kind of remember that comment. That Team usually seems chill though, maybe it wasn&#x27;t really a serious comment? For the record, I think your hosting at quiz nights was pretty good!
- [Nov. 10, 2022, 1:24 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/dada1d361d46749900f410659fb33368/): I tried out https://tweethunter.io/generate-tweets today and honestly all of these are pretty good except that one about responding to emails. (I would never have 100 unread emails)
- [Nov. 10, 2022, 11:38 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/1590549484869943300/): @paulcatiang the proper response would be something like &quot;kasi madaming kagaya mo na ayaw magisip para sa sarili?&quot;
