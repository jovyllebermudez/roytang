- [May 31, 2022, 10:29 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/v1rk0c/): Posted on r/Philippines: How did the MRT&#x27;s old stored value tickets work? Haven&#x27;t ridden the MRT regularly for a long while, I assume these were phased out since may Beep card na. Specifically, where did they store value? I remember parang thin magnetic (?) card lang sya na parang wala namang chip. And if writeable sya, wouldn&#x27;t that be insecure, i.e. people might figure out how to change the value of the card. If there&#x27;s some kind of centralized database, wouldn&#x27;t that introduce some kind of network delay for example when the ticket is processed as you leave the station?
