- [1 Sep 2020 7:36pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1300880148518940672/): I&rsquo;m not unhappy about DFCs coming back to standard, but I am glad that I mostly only play #mtg on Arena these days so I don&rsquo;t have to deal with desleeving/helper cards all the time.
DFCs have unlocked a lot of design space for Magic, but they are so clunky on paper
- [1 Sep 2020 10:08am](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1300737200460632066/): Amonkhet Remastered draft ep12 (series finale) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgakr
Thankfully, the planned series finale and 13th draft didn&rsquo;t suck, actually went relatively well! But do we get the 7? YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvN3bQZz39k

- [28 Aug 2020 7:03am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g341dg1/): Very regular occurrence here in the Philippines unfortunately. After a presidential election, it’s not uncommon that most of the legislators jump ship to the president’s party (or their allies), presumably so they can partake of the spoils of the majority.
- [28 Aug 2020 4:55am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g33ryjz/): Nah man, stores over here carry both R1 and R3 (sometimes R2)
