- [May 15, 2021, 2:44 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/1393457163608018947/): Gonna attempt this today. I have poor manual dexterity so I expect it to be terrible #onepiece Most challenging part for me and my shaky fingers are the tiny tiny stickers
- [May 15, 2021, 10:47 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/1393397698439520259/): @Woerlan aren&#x27;t you mostly a commander player now anyway? Were you still following the pro scene? (I know I wasn&#x27;t) Still hoping GPs come back in one form or another though, those were fun
- [May 14, 2021, 8:55 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/1393188144049098752/): #StreetFighterV: Why does the higher ranked guy get 2.5x more league points than I lose? Seems like his win points should be downscaled for beating a lower ranked guy.
- [May 13, 2021, 9 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/1392827143109832705/): Snoopy shocked by scandalous snowmen #sketchdaily 132/365 (I may or may not have reused the Calvin and Hobbes part from an older sketch)
- [May 12, 2021, 8:13 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/1392452974719340545/): Robin riding a reindeer #sketchdaily 131/365
