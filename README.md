- [July 14, 2021, 5:14 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/07/1415238174377340930/): #Loki spoiler-free review: overall plot was fine, if not predictable, given what we knew about mcu phase 4 going in weak pacing and writing in most episodes; could have easily been a two hour movie instead of six one hour episodes good watch for mcu fans because of the larger phase 4 implications, but much weaker as a standalone series
