- [Dec. 19, 2022, 6:45 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/1604608825742331904/): It&#x27;s amazing how much this epitomizes what&#x27;s happening to Elon&#x27;s twitter Quoted RottenInDenmark&#x27;s tweet: I think we&#x27;ll look back on the last decade as a time when social media gave previously marginalized groups the ability to speak directly to elites and, as a result, elites lost their minds.
- [Dec. 19, 2022, 6:42 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/1604608028308709376/): Sigh. It&#x27;s like every morning I wake up to better than even odds of more Twitter nonsense and here we are. I might be done. More later. Quoted TwitterSupport&#x27;s tweet: We recognize that many of our users are active on other social media platforms. However, we will no longer allow free promotion of certain social media platforms on Twitter. [12:32] Lol tweets already deleted
