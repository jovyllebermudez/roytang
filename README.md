- [April 8, 2023, 11:38 a.m. Movies: Murder Mystery 2 (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/murder-mystery-2-2023/): Needed a light film to watch in the background, settled on this one from NF recommendations. I have almost no memory of what happened in the first film.Sandler and Aniston&#x27;s characters are now bumbling amateur detectives who rapidly stumble into happening to solve a kidnapping (and several murders). The humor is about what you&#x27;d expect for this kind of movie.It reminds me of Rush Hour 3 for some reason, but that might just be because they also went to Paris (and that is the only detail I remember from Rush Hour 3)Film is entertaining enough as popcorn fare that you
- [April 6, 2023, 11:47 p.m. Movies: Moneyball (2011)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/moneyball-2011/): My mom said she tried to watch some Brad Pitt film about sports but found it boring because there was so much talking. I realized later that she was referring to this film and decided to finally watch it.It&#x27;s pretty good! It&#x27;s a film about sports, but not really a sports film. And also a film about trying out new things and challenging industry preconceptions. The pacing and shots and how the pivotal moments in the team&#x27;s season are portrayed are all well-executed.Definitely the sort of film for my mom though.
- [April 6, 2023, 11:43 p.m. Movies: Thor (2011)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/thor-2011/): First time rewatching this in a long while, mostly because I&#x27;ve been reading the old Thor comics and couldn&#x27;t remember what the Warriors Three looked like in the MCU. Volstagg is nowhere near as voluminous as he was in the comics!I think the film holds up reasonably well, though it&#x27;s nowhere as good as say, Iron Man. Does a reasonable job of introducing the Asgard mythos and the Asgard set pieces still look pretty good.
- [April 4, 2023, 11:31 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/04/jevk0z1/): Lots of online discussions from the past 20 years about to be lost forever. They should at least consider seeding the forum database as a torrent or something so that it exists somewhere
