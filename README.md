I didn&#x27;t help a lot with this one after the initial framing. Also, my mom insists the structures on top are ruined buildings, I can&#x27;t convince her they&#x27;re some kind of red rock formations.

A very hateable villain, especially for animal lovers. The Guardians crew are at the best they&#x27;ve ever been; the banter and the coordination fighting alongside each other are a testament of how they&#x27;ve grown together as a found family. The films gives a fitting end to the story arcs for most of our Guardians crew.Some plot nitpicks here and there, and my brother though the film was just a tad too long, but nothing too problematic. James Gunn has more or less
