- [19 Jul 2020 12:00am](https://roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-19/): Pandemic thoughts and updates, July 19 edition:

Now everyone in their household is staying in separate rooms and eating separately while they wait to be tested. After a week and a half, out of 5 adults who need to be tested, only 2 have been tested and gotten their results (prioritized because they were seniors).
