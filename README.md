- [June 4, 2021, 3:42 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400719659335229441/): My favorite story about the face shield requirement is that early in the pandemic, a friend couldnt get into the grocery because he didnt have a face shield, so he just stuck a sandwich bag to his face and they let him in He eventually needed to get a face shield because he didn&#x27;t want to make more sandwiches
- [June 4, 2021, 10:04 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400634591166156805/): Binged thru S5 of Kim&#x27;s Convenience yesterday. Still so easy to background-watch. Too bad it&#x27;s the final season, they still had a few open threads to resolve. https://www.avclub.com/simu-liu-opens-up-about-his-anger-and-unhappiness-over-1847022561 Apparently there&#x27;s a planned spinoff starring Shannon, who&#x27;s the second-worst character on the show! WTH. (Worst character is Janet lol)
- [June 4, 2021, 9:09 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400620815381524480/): Not a fan of the how the active tab renders in the new version of Firefox. that doesn&#x27;t look like a tab!
