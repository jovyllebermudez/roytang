- [March 31, 2023, 4:28 p.m. Popquiz: Last Woman Standing](https://roytang.net/2023/03/popquiz-lastwoman/): Last week we attended the first PopQuiz for the year. And CRUSHED IT! Rounds were: TV and Streaming - 9pts (x2 for successful ace) Personalities - 6pts Video and Board Games - 2pts (lol) Movies - 7pts (x2 for powerup) Literature - 3pts Music - 6pts They had a new &quot;Hail Mary&quot; mechanic, where you could replace your lowest scoring round with your score from an extra enumeration question (noted as &quot;HM5&quot; - 5 pts in the attached image), but only if your team ordered a certain amount of food and drinks from the resto. Boo, pay to win! (We

- [March 27, 2023, 8:36 p.m. Movies: John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/03/john-wick-chapter-4-2023/): My friends asked me how this movie was and I was like &quot;It meets expectations. You kind of imagine what a new John Wick movie would be like, and this is exactly that.&quot; Great action sequences as usual.
