- [Feb. 22, 2021, 4:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363765401742569474/): Time to (re)mix it up! This pixel perfect adventure is one you don’t want to miss. Your browser does not support the video tag.
- [Feb. 22, 2021, 3:09 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363747640391860225/): For some reason, I watched Space Sweepers, a Korean sci-fi movie on Netflix. Fun ride, fairly entertaining, pretty good setpieces and special effects. (They are so far ahead of the local film industry.) Plot a bit predictable. Villain made no sense.
- [Feb. 21, 2021, 5:12 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363416285535604741/): Liliana of the dark #sketchdaily 52/365. Probably wasnt the best idea to try this with black and blue pens
