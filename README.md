Was underprepared and lost too much time brainstorming and struggling with Godot 4 and physics issues etc. All I have is throwing the pineapple: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9ElbNuGqZY Might be worth a blog post later. #ldjam
- [April 28, 2023, 2:08 p.m. Friday afternoon MTGMOM drafting](https://roytang.net/2023/04/9e7a844a48603ec5c429133eab420d1c/): https://twitch.tv/twitchyroy #twitch #mtgmom #mtg #magicarena [2023-04-30 14:31] These drafts did not go well, ending with 1 and 3 wins respectively. Sigh, I have yet to find my legs in this format. Skipping this weekend&#x27;s Arena Open because I feel so unprepared. Maybe Quick Drafts will be better?YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXUiNzQsfAk (Click photos to view full-size)
