- [14 Jul 2020 10:53pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1283172770377940992/): I must confess, I don&rsquo;t understand what &ldquo;anti-cancel culture&rdquo; people hope to accomplish. Do they think we should not be allowed to dislike other people&rsquo;s opinions?
- [12 Jul 2020 3:01pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1282329311496695808/): The screencapped tweet and the preceding discussions reveal a particularly insidious mindset among the fanatics: (a) they understand full well what this admin is doing despite the palace&rsquo;s BS claims of &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; (1/x)
Quoted MaoiArroyo&#39;s tweet:   Nope. Never have and never will. I made my &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; money investing in the Filipino people. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; money because I have enough saved up to say that if pressured.
- [12 Jul 2020 12:00am](https://roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-12/): Pandemic thoughts and updates, July 12 edition:
 haven&rsquo;t had a haircut since January. Been urged to go out and get one, but feels like an unnecessary risk. As a friend of mine said &ldquo;Like, it&rsquo;s one thing to get sick because I picked up groceries or something. Would feel really dumb to be intubated because I wanted a haircut&rdquo; Did a grocery run yesterday. Not too crowded. Hopefully didn&rsquo;t get sick.
- [11 Jul 2020 4:16pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1281985727350206470/): @quizandhers Oh, thanks for reporting!
- [10 Jul 2020 10:14am](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1281532170788429825/): Ang mensahe nila ay GMA-7, ABC-5 at ibang media - huwag nyo saktan ang Pangulo ha. At wag na wag nyo kaming banatan sa expose nyo. Maging tuta na lang kayo. Tulad namin. #DefendPressFreedom
