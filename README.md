- [Feb. 9, 2023, 6:45 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/02/dee35db04d4629f35cfcaae54c27a575/): Drafting some Phyrexia All Will Be One! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #twitch #mtg #mtgone [23:15] Had an excellent first day of MTGONE drafts on https://indieweb.social/tags/magicarena&quot; class=&quot;mention hashtag&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;#magicarena! Drafts went 6 and 7, good start to the season!YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIHVi8zFbjk (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Feb. 9, 2023, 1:45 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/02/109830360718613258/): @neauoire hello! I was poking around on this search engine and I found that there are some webring member sites that are not indexed (mine included). May I ask what is the criteria for not being indexed?
- [Feb. 7, 2023, 6:42 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/02/1622908668705656832/): Occasionally I look into the &quot;For You&quot; tab to see what it&#x27;s like being among the unwashed masses and my first question is always &quot;Why are my own tweets here?&quot; I have by definition already seen them!
- [Feb. 7, 2023, 1:01 a.m. Movies: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007)](https://roytang.net/2023/02/fantastic-four-rise-of-the-silver-surfer-2007/): I was not happy with the original so I never bothered watching this one, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad actually, maybe a slight improvement over the original even, though that&#x27;s not a high bar to clear. Still not happy with Doom&#x27;s BS powers coming back into play (and they didn&#x27;t even bother explaining why he&#x27;s still around lol). I understand space cloud Galactus was kind of silly, but I would imagine a gigantic guy in a hat would not have played well in theaters in 2007. Was nice to see Chris Evans being brash and annoying instead of the do-gooder
