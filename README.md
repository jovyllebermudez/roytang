- [April 17, 2022, 7:05 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1515647731209244679/): Nothing is a mistake. There‚Äôs no win and no fail. There‚Äôs only make. This quote has been attributed to John Cage, when it is, in fact, from a list of principles for a class taught by artist and educator Sister Corita Kent in 1967-1968. Her principles for creativity follow. (Click photos to view full-size)
- [April 17, 2022, 2:12 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1515573837013811203/): Lahat tayo magsisilbing Liwanag Sa Dilim ‚òÄÔ∏è Maraming salamat sa ating mga Volunteer Film Workers, Artists, and supporters from different communities na naging kabahagi natin sa paglikha ng music video na ito! üôèüèª #LeniLiwanagSaDilim Your browser does not support the video tag.
- [April 14, 2022, 11:14 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/i4nlx1b/): A card&#x27;s color identity is not the same as its color. [[Tazri, Beacon of Unity]] has a color identity of WUBRG because of the rule you mentioned, but it&#x27;s still only a white creature (can&#x27;t be bounced by [[Aether Gust]] etc). Color identity is really only relevant for commander/brawl purposes.
- [April 13, 2022, 8:59 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/i4k5wbi/): Your sideboard guide has -2 lantern vs control but only one in the main.
- [April 13, 2022, 3:21 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1514141710569275395/): Me and my 80 year old Lola talking about the successful rallies of VP Leni, then my aunt who&#x27;s Marcos loyalist passed by and overheard our convo. Tita: Basta ako BBM ako Lola: Bahala ka kung sino gusto mo iboto! (in angry sarcastic voice) 1/2
