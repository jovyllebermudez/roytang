- [July 28, 2023, 3:05 p.m. PopQuiz 7th Anniversary: The Last Seven Years](https://roytang.net/2023/07/popquiz-seven-years-later/): Last night (Thursday) was PQ&#x27;s 7th anniversary quiz; each round features pop culture questions from one of the past seven years (or two years for the pandemic). This quiz also had a gimmick where for each question, the teams would vote (by raising some cards) whether the question should be about &quot;Movies&quot;, &quot;TV/Streaming&quot;, &quot;Music&quot; or &quot;People, Events and Things&quot; of the appropriate era. We could have done better if only people didn&#x27;t keep choosing Music lol Rounds were: 2016 - 5pts 2017 - 5pts 2018 - 2pts 2019 - 6pts (x2 for power-up) 2020-2021 (pandemic years) - 6pts 2022-present -
