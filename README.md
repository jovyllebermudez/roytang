- [June 9, 2021, 8:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/nvukbz/): Posted on r/Philippines: I&#x27;m looking for an old Pugad Baboy strip Baka merong may copy. In the strip, Patrolman Durugas has stopped Mang Dagul for a traffic violation, tapos pinilisopo sya ni Dagul, so binigyan sya ng ticket, nakasulat &quot;violation: pilosopo&quot; I would guess it&#x27;s from the early books, kasi I remember medyo raw pa yung art style. Probably somewhere in books 1-3, kasi I have book 4 here, parang mas polished na yung art. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help! (Bakit walang flair na &quot;Question&quot;? Sige na nga, &quot;Culture&quot; na lang)

Quoted peard33&#x27;s tweet: Apple said a new &quot;private relay&quot; feature designed to obscure users&#x27; web browsing behavior from internet service providers and advertisers will not be available in China for regulatory reasons. Same in Belarus, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the Philippines &amp; more. via @StephenNellis
