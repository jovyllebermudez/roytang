- [Feb. 20, 2021, 3:24 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363026665819938819/): I did a couple of #kaldheim sealed events again to practice for the open. I felt like the pools were good, but I had so many misplays, I only finished 2-3 and 3-3. Here&#x27;s hoping I perform better tomorrow #mtg #magicarena
- [Feb. 20, 2021, 9:21 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362935326239465472/): @art_abon the only surviving humans are the descendants of the first Mars colonists. Their only government: The SpaceX board of directors
- [Feb. 19, 2021, 11:18 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362783672357724161/): The year is 2398. Earth is no longer habitable, the surviving humans have migrated to space colonies. The entire Earth has been converted into a supercluster of quantum computers with one purpose: to mine bitcoin
