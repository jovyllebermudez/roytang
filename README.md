- [April 19, 2021, 4:59 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1384069042672001024/): Monday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven Only one draft this session, but I had a lot of fun! Mostly because it was my first 7-win of the season, but also because I drafted an insane quandrix deck with the other 3 colors splashed, and won 3 games off Approach of the Second Sun. I never got to activate codie though! YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJcwQML48LQ
- [April 19, 2021, 3:28 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1384046109945843712/): Someone tried to scam me out of my Netflix account. Weird because its never actually asked me to 2fa before. (Yes, I have reset my pw) Ah i suppose it might have been someone using my phone from the recent fb data leak to try to reset the pw.

- [April 17, 2021, 12:43 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1383279982311399434/): Saturday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven Managed to do 2 drafts today. First one with Witherbloom only went 3 wins, but I managed 4 wins with the second one using Quandrix before a matchmaking bug ended my draft prematurely (hopefully we get reimbursed!)
