- [Dec. 10, 2022, 6:46 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/reddit-recap/): It&#x27;s that time of the year, when online companies like Reddit give you stats! (I love stats!) Seems like I spent way more on Reddit this year, probably due to enjoying all the Alchemy drama on r/MagicArena lol Annoyance: On mobile, your recap can only be accessed by downloading the mobile app. Also, I wish they had text-only versions of this data. Previously: Reddit Recap 2021
- [Dec. 8, 2022, 10:29 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/grisham/): Found some old John Grisham #books among my shelves. They look well-read, but I do not remember the plots of these books at all! It&#x27;s probably been at least 20 years since I read them! I think the only Grisham book I do remember reading and still vaguely remember the plot is The Firm.
- [Dec. 8, 2022, 10:25 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/duolingo-stats/): Huh, even #Duolingo has year-end stats now. Did this only start this year?
- [Dec. 8, 2022, 10:16 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/mtgbro-limited-6/): #MTGBRO drafts have been challenging for me so far on #MagicArena, but tonight I finally got my first trophy in the format! Tonight&#x27;s two quick drafts went to 7 and 5 respectively, the best night of the run so far. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uuDtyil5fA
- [Dec. 6, 2022, 10:16 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/mtgbro-limited-5/): Tried quick drafting some #MTGBRO today on #MagicArena, it did not go well. Both runs went 1-3. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfdcll6ghio
