- [May 23, 2021, 2:45 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/1396356641285566466/): This reminded me of the Rick and Morty episode “Get Schwifty” https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Get_Schwifty https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1fZ7Ap6ebs&amp;feature=youtu.be Quoted johnayliff&#x27;s tweet: I don&#x27;t have time to learn how to make mods for Stellaris, but if I did...

Area for improvement!
