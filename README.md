- [1 Sep 2020 10:08am](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1300737200460632066/): Amonkhet Remastered draft ep12 (series finale) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgakr
Thankfully, the planned series finale and 13th draft didn&rsquo;t suck, actually went relatively well! But do we get the 7? YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvN3bQZz39k
- [28 Aug 2020 8:24am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1299261506622615552/): @bloodyvints is this already out?
- [28 Aug 2020 7:03am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g341dg1/): Very regular occurrence here in the Philippines unfortunately. After a presidential election, it’s not uncommon that most of the legislators jump ship to the president’s party (or their allies), presumably so they can partake of the spoils of the majority.
- [28 Aug 2020 4:55am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g33ryjz/): Nah man, stores over here carry both R1 and R3 (sometimes R2)
- [27 Aug 2020 10:42am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1298933974887280645/): Thursday evening Amonkhet Remastered draft (ep11) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgakr #twitch
I decided to do two drafts and both were terrible! Sigh. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmExO-0s_yQ
