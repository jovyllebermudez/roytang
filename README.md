- [March 4, 2022, 11:37 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/03/hzbsdvk/): It&#x27;s even more annoying given that a good part of the world is still in a pandemic, and many would have been unable or unwilling to go out to theaters to watch in the first few days, and after that people just casually drop spoilers wherever. I was only able to watch No Way Home a couple of weeks ago because there was an Omicron surge in my country at the time it came out and I had no way to watch it safely.

This film went from slow burn to sudden, graphic violence real quick. The protagonist hardly says anything. Very neo-noir. The director lingers on every shot, letting the audience soak up the mood. I feel like Ryan Gosling here is playing the same type of character he was in Blade Runner 2046, but I haven&#x27;t seen enough of his movies to know if that&#x27;s typical for his range.
