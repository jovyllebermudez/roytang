One more day of practice remains, hopefully we get another good day. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1toimLBgw8 (Click photos to view full-size)

(Coulda sworn it wasn&#x27;t on Prime Video last year). It was ok. Ben Affleck&#x27;s performance wasn&#x27;t outstanding or anything, and the setup in the first half took a bit too long and was mostly just people talking and such, but the action-thriller part in the second half was good. I can see how releasing this in the climate less than a year after 9/11 might have been problematic though.
