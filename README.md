- [April 12, 2021, 3:28 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1381509474259673090/): Needed something light to watch in the background, so I watched Airplane! (1980). It&#x27;s the kind of movie where they just stuff in as many gags as possible, every throwaway line and even stuff happening in the background is a gag.
- [April 12, 2021, 3:27 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1381509157480591362/): People need to learn to stop sending scanned documents sideways. Your scanner software has a setting for the document orientation!
- [April 12, 2021, 2:07 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1381489041082736643/): Pwede ka sumingit sa pila. Pag may nagkwestyon sa yo sagutin mo ng &quot;that&#x27;s an unchristian question&quot;
- [April 12, 2021, 10:53 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1381440285188661251/): @MadamHiddles The article says the photo is from 2021
