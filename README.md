- [April 13, 2023, 8:47 p.m. Movies: Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-2023/): This was so good. Fresh, fun and witty adventure, and so many references for those familiar with the source material. I liked the Paladin and the Druid, but all the characters are quite good and reasonably fleshed out and likeable and the performances are pretty good. This is what I wish MCU movies could be like since Endgame.
- [April 12, 2023, 10:36 p.m. Geekfight Then Now Forever](https://roytang.net/2023/04/geekfight-then-now-forever/): We came back to GeekFight looking for revenge, but our (my) D&amp;D and WWE knowledge fell short. Rounds were: Returns and Revivals - 8pts Adapted Works - 16pts (Joker) D&amp;D - 4pts. Miserable, especially since if we were thinking straight we might have managed as high as a 7 here Music - 3pts. Their selection of mashups and covers continues to confound us Sequels and Spinoffs - 6pts WWE - 2pts. Lol this went about as well as I expected. At least we managed to tie for 2nd this time, within striking distance of the winning team, an improvement from
- [April 12, 2023, 11:38 a.m. Explorer Metagame Challenge](https://roytang.net/2023/04/explorer-metagame-challenge/): Did a few runs on the Explorer Metagame challenge on Arena with a couple of different decks: Run 1: 2 wins (-500 gold +1 pack) Creativity Run 2: 4 wins (+500 gold +5 packs) Rogues Run 3: 2 wins (-500 gold +1 pack) Rogues Run 4: 3 wins (+0 gold +3 packs) Rogues So total record was 11 wins, 4 losses, -500 gold, +10 packs. Explorer is a fun and varied format but wow I had forgotten how long BO3 games tend to play. Each of these runs took longer than a typical Premier Draft, even though I never went
