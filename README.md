- [April 15, 2021, 6:05 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/ced0a77eea2857ad31bd014fac3ded9a/): Bond film no. 8: Live and Let Die (1973). Moore feels a lot more &quot;generic white guy&quot; than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There&#x27;s a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There&#x27;s a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.

If we can&#x27;t catch them, we should at least make it socially unacceptable Quoted rodelalbert&#x27;s tweet: I saw an acquaintance on ig who recently posted he got vaccinated and I asked if he was in the group A category. Turns out nasa friends of the VIP category pala sya.
