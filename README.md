- [Jan. 23, 2023, 8:23 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/spyxfamily/): Spy X Family: Been watching this for a few weeks now. Slowed down a bit because Netflix lost the English dubs in the second half of the season. The show is surprisingly funny given it&#x27;s premise. Anya being secretly a telepath but also being an idiot provides for a hilarious POV and is a good contrast to Loid&#x27;s hypercompetent and always serious superspy persona. Yor is a bit underdeveloped as a character, but I guess it&#x27;s early still. Even the side characters which I initially thought would be annoying end up having hilarious motivations. I enjoyed the season enough that
- [Jan. 23, 2023, 8:22 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/that90sshow/): That 90s Show dropped on Netflix this past week, I already finished the season. I think they did a good job nailing the general mood of the show and the 90s aesthetic, though it feels a bit like it&#x27;s trying too hard at some points. The compressed season length doesn&#x27;t give the characters much space to developer, so compared to the original show, everything feels a bit rushed or crammed in. Let&#x27;s face it, we&#x27;re all here for the cameos from the original show anyway. It was weird seeing Wilder Valderama be Fez again when I&#x27;ve been watching him be
- [Jan. 23, 2023, 10:21 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/10j1alz/): Posted on r/fireTV: Why is the Prime Video app on Fire Stick so bad? I set up a Fire Stick on my Mom&#x27;s non-smart TV so she can watch Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video, and the PV app is without question the worst of these. The two main problems: it always logs in as the main profile (mine) instead of the subprofile I made for my mom. I would prefer having a profile selection screen whenever you open the app (the app for LG WebOS does this) the Options menu (available while playing via the hamburger button the remote) doesn&#x27;t

Finished 2-3 =/ Before I went in, I reviewed my Kaldheim Limited Review, and it looks like I did terribly in that format. So it&#x27;s not surprising that I didn&#x27;t too well this time either!
- [Jan. 19, 2023, 12:56 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/10fcbbx/): Posted on r/MarvelUnlimited: Does is anyone know why Captain America #400 is incomplete on MU? It only has the main story from operation galatic storm. Looks like there should also be backups with falcon and usagent rescuing dman and diamondback/crossbones origin story
