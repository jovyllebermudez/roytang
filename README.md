- [Aug. 15, 2023, 11:34 p.m. Movies: Heart of Stone (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/08/heart-of-stone-2023/): My mom&#x27;s review: I didn&#x27;t really understand, but I liked the action. Gal Gadot is so good! (I think she meant the character is hypercompetent.)The film obviously goes for the Mission Impossible vibe with the action sequences and set pieces, though the story here is a bit like the opposite of Dead Reckoning. The plot here was a bit rough around the edges but the action was good and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. And honestly, I think Gal Gadot&#x27;s acting is starting to get a bit better.
- [Aug. 12, 2023, 12:01 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/08/jvqwiz5/): Wait, dont you just sort by upgradeable and the upgradeable one will be at the top of the list?
- [Aug. 11, 2023, 10:04 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/08/15o9ubc/): Posted on r/MarvelUnlimited: West Coast Avengers #83-88 Are they not on the app or I’m just bad at searching? Why would they be missing? There were also 3 earlier nonsequential issues listed under “Avengers West Coast” which was also annoying
- [Aug. 10, 2023, 11:44 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/08/jvll02q/): I think they should introduce a new paper-accurate format that is &quot;all the paper cards in arena&quot;, including the fetches and cards like counterspell and lightning bolt. It would be wild. Also, it would have the added benefit of cutting off all the whining about &quot;Alchemy in Historic&quot; (people would just find something new to whine about, but at least it would be new!)
