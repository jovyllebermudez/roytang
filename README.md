- [June 2, 2021, 9:35 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400083631519850498/): Would love to be proven wrong, but I dont think they would withdraw the face shield mandate because that would involve admitting to a mistake. Quoted gideonlasco&#x27;s tweet: It will take around 500 years for face shields to decompose, but it will only take 5 seconds for IATF to admit that they made a mistake in requiring it in all settings.
- [June 2, 2021, 9:08 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400076977722195969/): Hot air balloon ride #sketchdaily for June 1 (almost there!) 151/365 Just realized I made a counting mistake around 40 sketches ago, so this one should be 152/365 instead
- [June 2, 2021, 8:52 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400072956613517322/): Blackberries #sketchdaily for May 31 (still catching up) 150/365 (Correction: 151/365)
- [June 2, 2021, 4:44 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/cbb6135fa20b48a488982eccc7df76ce/): Watched Moonraker (1979). Spectacular opening sequence. Villain reminds me of Tyrion Lannister. California -&gt; Venice -&gt; Rio de Janeiro. Mandatory canal chase while in Venice, obviously. Lots of of product placement. A bad guy tried to ambush 007 with a KENDO STICK. Have they heard of guns? Comically indestructible assassin Jaws appears again, and actually has a character arc this time. First half of the movie was kind of meh, but the last third of the film with the space station and the laser battles and the ridiculous villain plan kind of won me over with how campy it all
