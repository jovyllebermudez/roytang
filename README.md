- [May 7, 2022, 1:23 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/1522809232411676677/): @mlq3 Am currently doing my list; I&#x27;ve found some red flags raised about D&#x27;Angelo (mismanagement of some cosplay funds?) and Cabonegro (predator accusations?).

- [May 7, 2022, 5:25 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/1522689087315931137/): @ainsleysdad11 it&#x27;s unnecessary to message me directly, I can see replies to the bot
- [May 6, 2022, 7:32 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/1522539735159300097/): Drafting Streets of New Capenna! ep3 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgsnc #twitch [23:41] Today&#x27;s drafts did not go as well as last time. First draft went a reasonable 5-3, but then I tried the RG archetype and went a miserable 0-3. We&#x27;ll try to do better next week!
