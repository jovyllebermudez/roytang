Quoted AP&#x27;s tweet: In a rare admission of the weakness of Chinese coronavirus vaccines, the countryâ€™s top disease control official says their effectiveness is low and the government is considering mixing them to give them a boost. http://apne.ws/tVtFgS2

Connery&#x27;s hair starting to go a bit gray in his last appearance. More Blofeld than I&#x27;d expected (harhar). Space laser! Plenty O&#x27;Toole seemed pointless, there just to die. A lot of cheesy lines from the assassin henchment. These movies would be a lot shorter if they just shot Bond whenever they caught him. The action scenes in all these old Bond films always feel so jarring compared to modern ones. Limited by the technology of their time I guess.
