Quoted peard33&#x27;s tweet: Apple said a new &quot;private relay&quot; feature designed to obscure users&#x27; web browsing behavior from internet service providers and advertisers will not be available in China for regulatory reasons. Same in Belarus, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the Philippines &amp; more. via @StephenNellis

After the sci-fi fantasy of Moonraker, this one is more grounded and down-to-Earth, a callback to early Connery adventures. No megamalomaniacs to defeat, just foreign agents and mercs. The opening sequence pays homage to the earlier pre-Moore films, acknowledging the death of Tracy Bond and killing off a villain that looks suspiciously like arch-nemesis Blofeld. The opening song is pretty good. The rest of the film was ok, if a bit forgettable. I liked the rock climbing scene, but the ski chase and car chases felt like things we&#x27;ve seen before.
