- [Jan. 23, 2023, 10:21 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/10j1alz/): Posted on r/fireTV: Why is the Prime Video app on Fire Stick so bad? I set up a Fire Stick on my Mom&#x27;s non-smart TV so she can watch Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video, and the PV app is without question the worst of these. The two main problems: it always logs in as the main profile (mine) instead of the subprofile I made for my mom. I would prefer having a profile selection screen whenever you open the app (the app for LG WebOS does this) the Options menu (available while playing via the hamburger button the remote) doesn&#x27;t

Finished 2-3 =/ Before I went in, I reviewed my Kaldheim Limited Review, and it looks like I did terribly in that format. So it&#x27;s not surprising that I didn&#x27;t too well this time either!
- [Jan. 19, 2023, 12:56 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/10fcbbx/): Posted on r/MarvelUnlimited: Does is anyone know why Captain America #400 is incomplete on MU? It only has the main story from operation galatic storm. Looks like there should also be backups with falcon and usagent rescuing dman and diamondback/crossbones origin story
- [Jan. 17, 2023, 9:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/109704744130699285/): @jikodesu do you need to have the DDG app as the default browser to use this?
- [Jan. 16, 2023, 7:57 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/1614954978602520576/): @Westraid Happy birthday!
