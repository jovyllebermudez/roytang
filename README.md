- [Oct. 20, 2022, 11 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/popquiz-stage/): We skipped a couple of months of PopQuiz, but we&#x27;re back! Rounds were: Drag Performers - 5pts Concerts and Festival - 7pts BTS - 20pts with Ace (good job Army teammates!) Live Theater - 3pts Fictional Competitions - 6pts Video Games (audio round) - 8pts with powerup We saved our powerup for the video games round because we didn&#x27;t know it was an audio round which was much tougher. The (very blurry because I was in a rush) board picture below implies we tied for 1st with 49pts, but actually after the tiebreaker (WHICH WAS ALSO TIED), the 3rd place
