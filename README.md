Maybe try some other archetypes next time? YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dctRWIvwJE
- [Aug. 1, 2021, 12:46 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/08/1421693688900505603/): Managed to clear the #mtgarena Standard Open in just under an hour using @urlichmtg &#x27;s Monowhite Book list. Wasted a bunch of gems though, since I had a first run that was plagued by network issues on my end. Still, looking forward to day 2! [2021-08-02 02:06] Unfortunately, day 2 didn&#x27;t go quite as well. Finished day 2 at 5-2, just short of cash prizes! Such is life. Deck was a great choice though! BO3 decklist attached for reference.
