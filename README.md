- [March 16, 2023, 12:17 a.m. Movies: My Cousin Vinny (1992)](https://roytang.net/2023/03/my-cousin-vinny-1992/): Watched this one because I recently read about how Marisa Tomei&#x27;s oscar win was a bit controversial because she was a newcomer. I really enjoyed the film and the way it set up expectations for Vinny&#x27;s courtroom smackdown in the third act. Not sure if Oscar-worthy, but both Tomei and Pesci gave good performances, especially with Mona Lisa on the stand. Thoroughly enjoyable!

- [March 10, 2023, 5:56 a.m. MTGONE Draft 7](https://roytang.net/2023/03/mtgone-draft-7/): Did another off-stream draft last night, a premier one this time, spending gold to try to restock my gem balance after the disastrous Arena Open Weekend. It went well, the draft went to 6, so profit~ I actually learned a lot from the quick drafts I think, I wouldn&#x27;t have been sure how to draft this kind of RG deck before. Was tempted to do a second one but (a) didn&#x27;t have time; and (b) let&#x27;s not push our luck (or our gem total!)

Kudos to Globe actually for getting someone out here the day after I reported the problem to their CS messenger bot. (And to the crew for not making me wait all afternoon) The problem was some loose connection outside our house. Their comms could be improved though. The SMS I got yesterday just said someone will &quot;reach out to me&quot;, I had to call this morning to confirm we&#x27;re getting a site visit. Losing internet for 24h felt forever though.
