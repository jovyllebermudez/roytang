- [Jan. 21, 2021, 11:43 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1352280628490747906/): Platforms should not be responsible for a person making awful content. They are absolutely responsible when they put it in front of people who didnâ€™t even know it existed. They should know the difference between hosting awful content and choosing to broadcast it. We all should.
