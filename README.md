Jan 15 Controller 15/365 Jan 16 Jyn Erso 16/365 Jan 17 Jewelry 17/365 Jan 18 Rachel Summers 18/365 Someone gave me a new sketchbook, pencil and eraser a while back, I thought I&#x27;d give them a go. Haven&#x27;t used pencil in a while, I find myself thinking I can just undo (too used to digital) instead of going for the eraser. I need a sharpener. The Jyn Erso one is a second attempt at one I did in 2016, though I&#x27;m not sure this one is better.

Still looking forward to this! #mcu #trailers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Krla_UxRg
