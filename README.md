- [Jan. 8, 2021, 11:47 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1347631047215702016/): I have yet to see any Valki Vartokamus jokes and I am disappointed in all of you #mtg #MTGKaldheim Quoted SaffronOlive&#x27;s tweet: Geez, god/planeswalker MDFC. At first glance it seems really solid. Valki is good early, Tibalt gives you late game utility.
