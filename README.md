Then check if your normal account on the same PS3 can access it too (some dlc work when accessed this way). if not, then the only way is to play it via the HK account

- [July 4, 2021, 12:02 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/07/cb5279cfdbc686e55eef33bd58e8aaeb/): Saturday gaming group decided to do a movie watch-along while we played and randomly settled on Under Siege (1992) for some reason. I&#x27;d never seen it before and several times I said &quot;Isn&#x27;t this just Die Hard on a boat?&quot; and apparently that was a universal consensus. Very 90s. Unsurprisingly this is already Seagal&#x27;s best-rated movie and has a surprising number of familiar and even good actors, including Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, and Colm Meaney (Star Trek&#x27;s O&#x27;Brien)
