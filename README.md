- [July 19, 2022, 4:49 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/07/1549315521795002368/): Drafting some more Baldur&#x27;s Gate! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtghbg [21:49] First draft went very well, finishing with the 7-2. Second draft was a much worse 3-3, but both drafts combined to make the day profitable. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II8IaAMNwys (Click photos to view full-size)
- [July 14, 2022, 5:04 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/07/1547507375741042688/): Drafting some Baldur&#x27;s Gate again! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtghbg [22:21] The drafts today seemed good, but due to a mix of misplays and mana screw, I only got to 4-3 both times.

- [July 14, 2022, 4:17 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/07/1547495557358178304/): Just remembered that Marvel has two separate and unrelated groups of characters called Eternals and Externals and now I&#x27;m mad
- [July 13, 2022, 5:15 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/07/1547147705876500480/): Reminder that there is absolutely nothing stopping you from blogging this way still. Quoted emkey&#x27;s tweet: Does anyone remember blogging when it was really just you talking about your day and what interesting thing happened? Before sponsored posts and photo dumps. Before people cared about it being &quot;content&quot; and it was seriously just something you wanted to share.
