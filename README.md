- [May 15, 2023, 1:18 p.m. Movies: Police Story 3: Super Cop (1992)](https://roytang.net/2023/05/police-story-3-super-cop-1992/): Watched this only because I heard young Michelle Yeoh was in it, then realized afterwards that I&#x27;ve never actually seen Police Story 2.It was fine, lots of good fighting and stunts as would be expected. Michelle Yeoh looks so different especially during the earlier scenes; I think if I had seen this blind it might have taken me a while to recognize her. She did great though.I think I like the original Police Story a bit more; like the bus sequences in the third act of the first film were a bit more interesting than the train sequences here. Though
