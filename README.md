- [May 23, 2023, 12:13 p.m. Movies: The Raid (2011)](https://roytang.net/2023/05/the-raid-2011/): Intense and action-packed, great fight scenes

- [May 21, 2023, 1:22 p.m. More MOM drafting](https://roytang.net/2023/05/momdrafts/): I&#x27;m not streaming March of the Machine drafts anymore, but I did do some drafting online this past week, in prep for potentially playing in this weekend&#x27;s Arena Open. (Spoiler: I did not end up playing the open.) First up, I actually tried drafting on MTGO! It has been a long while - in fact I have no idea when I last played a game on MTGO, though I do login to check the account occasionally. When I checked my account, I saw that I actually had enough play points to enter a draft league, which I had never done
- [May 18, 2023, 11:53 p.m. Popquiz: Some Like It Hot](https://roytang.net/2023/05/popquiz-hot/): This was a difficult and low-scoring quiz night at one of the usual haunts. Despite a couple of terrible rounds and a poor choice of joker, we actually managed to finish 1pt away from tying for first! Scores for this game were super close, as is typical with difficult, wide-open nights. Rounds were: Hot Food - 2pts Hot Places - 5pts (x2 for powerup)* Hot People (reality/dating shows) - 4pts Heated Arguments (feuds and rivalries) - 2pts Billboard Hot 100 (bad google translated song lyrics) - 7pts (x2 for successful Ace!) Steamy Scenes - 5pts (Hail Mary) OG Viva Hot
