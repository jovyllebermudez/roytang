- [May 22, 2022, 8:21 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/1528350414508134400/): Got back home in time today to throw away some gems on the #MagicArena play-in sealed qualifier. Honestly thought the second build could go the distance, but maybe I sacrificed too much power for consistency. Jund build went 0-2. UW went 2-2. #mtgsnc (Click photos to view full-size)

Unfortunately, they both ended poorly at 2-3.
