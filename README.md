Was not disappointed. Fantastic visual design and cinematography. Lots of familiar actors showed up! Harrison Ford only appeared halfway through. I liked the reveal of how what the movie was telegraphing all along was a fake. [2021-11-11 09:31] I actually don&#x27;t remember when I watched the original (probably only within the past 10y or so; I never saw it during the time it came out) and don&#x27;t recall most of the plot, but I feel like this one was much
