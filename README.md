Until then, I won&#x27;t admit who they&#x27;re supposed to be!
- [Nov. 18, 2021, 7:44 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/11/1461118049990316036/): Some bonus non-streamed #MtgCrimson content: Did the midweek magic phantom quick draft on #magicarena, went UB exploit again. Thought my deck was pretty good but only went 3-2. Everyone was playing black! #mtg (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Nov. 17, 2021, 6:56 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/11/1460924682560024576/): Crimson Vow drafting! ep 3 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgcrimson [22:10] Tried out a couple of new archetypes today, ended up with 2 mediocre runs.

- [Nov. 16, 2021, 5:45 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/11/1460363252236386305/): So, not to pick on John, but this take is actually wrong and OP is right. Because something catastrophic did happen to Gen X and the Xennial&#x27;s music: the Telecommunication Act of 1996. It&#x27;s story time, kids... 1/ https://twitter.com/adr/status/1459998732506775554
