- [Feb. 8, 2021, 3:54 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gmeu5pi/): “please respect my belief that your beliefs are bullshit”
- [Feb. 7, 2021, 2:44 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1358305512517849089/): Sometimes I consider writing a regular newsletter about daily goings-on in the country, but I quickly realize I would quickly burn out on the sheer density of shenanigans our politicians/&quot;leaders&quot; get into. Probably not a job for a single person.

- [Feb. 5, 2021, 7:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1357650153709142017/): Gonna draft some more Kaldheim, keep me company if you like: https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #kaldheim I got the lantern again, but this draft didn&#x27;t go as well as the last one. Might have needed more lands. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGC-9xAO1Kk
