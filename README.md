- [Jan. 28, 2021, 1:57 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1354670019045584899/): The whole Gamestop brouhaha reminds me of the explanation I made for stock market prices a while back on reddit&#x27;s ELI5 forum: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c9plk/eli5_stock_prices_constantly_changing/dhtc9qo/?context=3 &quot;There is no magic formula that predicts what stock prices will be (whoever discovers that first will be rich). It&#x27;s largely a matter of perception and psychology. Sometimes stock prices move mainly because of rumors or speculation.&quot; -&gt; basically everything&#x27;s made up, lol And if I may add, if this reddit thing ends up as a catalyst to topple/reform capitalism, unlikely as it may seem, I would find that hilarious

- [Jan. 28, 2021, 3:13 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/gkxp5u8/): I followed the Sporza feed that was the result of pasting that url, and it looks like it&#x27;s the correct one: https://i.imgur.com/RK7pNDG.png
