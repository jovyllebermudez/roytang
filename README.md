- [Feb. 27, 2022, 3:57 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/02/1497843283480879118/): Threw some gems away on the #mtgneo #MagicArena open this weekend. My sealed deck felt good, and I had the choice of 2 or 4 colors, but the odds were not in my favor. I was bummed so I did a quick draft afterwards which went much better! YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chW2WWph4i8 (Click photos to view full-size) [16:01] Doing poorly at an Arena Open is roughly the same level of feel bad as doing poorly at a GP, except at least I didn&#x27;t have to travel and spend a bunch of money (only gems) just to get trounced!
- [Feb. 25, 2022, 6:21 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/02/1497154885002924037/): Neon Dynasty limited! ep10 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgneo [23:24] This was a good night; both drafts were profitable!

- [Feb. 24, 2022, 7:04 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/02/1496803090741215234/): Neon Dynasty limited! ep9 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy [2022-02-25 15:02] #mtg #magicarena #mtgneo #twitch Managed two drafts last night, but they were bleah. One more day of practice remains, hopefully we get another good day. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1toimLBgw8 (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Feb. 24, 2022, 8 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/02/a370090670a1a8b0e2adf4aa6156a412/): Watched this last night, since it was the last Jack Ryan movie I hadn&#x27;t seen yet. (Coulda sworn it wasn&#x27;t on Prime Video last year). It was ok. Ben Affleck&#x27;s performance wasn&#x27;t outstanding or anything, and the setup in the first half took a bit too long and was mostly just people talking and such, but the action-thriller part in the second half was good. I can see how releasing this in the climate less than a year after 9/11 might have been problematic though.
