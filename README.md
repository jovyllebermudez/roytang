Latest notes:

- [Aug. 19, 2023, 11:14 p.m. Geekfight: Shun the Nonbeliever](https://roytang.net/2023/08/geekfight-nonbeliever/): We attended the first game of the new Geekfight league at Moon Rabbit. The theme was &quot;myths and magic&quot; and it was a very challenging low-scoring game. Weapons and Artifacts - 3pts (x2 for joker) Spellcraft - 3pts Creatures and Constructs - 2pts Stage Magicians - 2pts Pantheons - 5pts Wielders of Magic - 5pts We counted 23pts total for us, but they had us at 25pts. There were a couple of questions where I thought they didn&#x27;t count our answer because it wasn&#x27;t exactly what was asked, but I guess they counted it? We ended up tied for 2nd
- [Aug. 10, 2023, 11:44 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/08/jvll02q/): I think they should introduce a new paper-accurate format that is &quot;all the paper cards in arena&quot;, including the fetches and cards like counterspell and lightning bolt. It would be wild. Also, it would have the added benefit of cutting off all the whining about &quot;Alchemy in Historic&quot; (people would just find something new to whine about, but at least it would be new!)
- [Aug. 10, 2023, 9:11 p.m. Movies: Hidden Strike (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/08/hidden-strike-2023/): Kinda fun, and Cena and Jacky have a bit of chemistry going but the plot is all over the place and I don&#x27;t even think they accomplished anything of use in the end? (except maybe vengeance?)
- [Aug. 7, 2023, 3:51 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/08/110847244216804146/): Renewed my driver&#x27;s license today. Last time I did this (6 years ago) it took me about an hour and cost around P1000. Today it took around 2.5hrs (they said they were having network issues) and cost P1245. I have the misfortune of needing to renew my license at times that they don&#x27;t have license cards to give, so I have once again paid for a receipt and a promise.
- [Aug. 3, 2023, 7:09 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/08/110825372228487230/): @jepoy where did you buy it from?
