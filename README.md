Finished 2-3 and 4-3. WU continues to be terrible for me.YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwOE70_lGmM (Click photos to view full-size)

- [Sept. 19, 2023, 7:25 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/09/111091563210893739/): Quick drafting Wilds of Eldraine! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #twitch #magicarena #mtg #mtgwoe [2023-09-20 13:11] Last night&#x27;s two quick draft decks looked good, but only got to 2-3 each.=/ As a friend pointed out during the stream it is highly likely I am drafting too quickly!YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2PBg_ug1Y8 (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Sept. 18, 2023, 11:02 p.m. Movies: The Italian Job (2003)](https://roytang.net/2023/09/the-italian-job-2003/): For some reason I came into this thinking it was about stealing cars? Some good driving scenes though. An entertaining heist movie; I love the ones that have elaborate heist plans that have to be adjusted at the last minute. Having Charlie and Stella end up together seemed unnecessary though.
