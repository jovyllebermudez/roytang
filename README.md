- [18 Jul 2020 6:30pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1284556159211368448/): 1/ There&rsquo;s a fascinating story of a normal guy named Allen Hemberger who became obsessed with the Alinea cookbook. He spent 5 years re-creating all 107 recipes.
There&rsquo;s an extremely valuable lesson in this process for anyone thinking about taking the leap to become a creator.
