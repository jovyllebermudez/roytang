This quote has been attributed to John Cage, when it is, in fact, from a list of principles for a class taught by artist and educator Sister Corita Kent in 1967-1968. Her principles for creativity follow. (Click photos to view full-size)

[[Tazri, Beacon of Unity]] has a color identity of WUBRG because of the rule you mentioned, but it&#x27;s still only a white creature (can&#x27;t be bounced by [[Aether Gust]] etc). Color identity is really only relevant for commander/brawl purposes.
