Latest notes:

- [April 11, 2023, 12:18 a.m. Movies: Extraction (2020)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/extraction-2020/): Wanted an action film to watch while doing other stuff, this was a pretty good choice. Was honestly a bit bored at the start but then they had this insanely long set of action sequences that look like they were all a single shot (I found out later that they weren&#x27;t, but still pretty impressive) and I started paying attention.The plot isn&#x27;t much to speak about, but the action sequences are pretty good and Hemsworth gives a pretty decent performance actually. Not bad, will probably give the sequel a shot.
- [April 9, 2023, 11:25 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/04/jfkvndb/): One option is to just seed it as a torrent and let other archivists worry about putting a readable/searchable copy online somewhere (I am also interested in seeing a dump) Isn&#x27;t the forum text-based only? i.e. they don&#x27;t host images? If it&#x27;s just text the data dump can&#x27;t be that large; if may images yeah, it might be a problem. Looking forward to an update soon!
- [April 9, 2023, 12:31 a.m. Twitter cuts off Flipboard](https://roytang.net/2023/04/6a8aa4fb02edb36018d3674551804fea/): I had several Flipboard sections reliant on Twitter lists, this is how they look now in the app. Clicking through any of the affected sections shows the same post explaining what happened
- [April 8, 2023, 11:51 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/04/1644729724760117248/): 4/4. Be a good assistant to yourself. Prepare and gather, make notations and sketches in your head or phone. When you work, all that mapping, architecture, research &amp; preparation will be your past self giving a gift to the future self that you are now. That is the sacred.
