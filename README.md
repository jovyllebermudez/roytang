I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!

The quintessential sports film, but I&#x27;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.

Decent outcome, but could have been better. I did manage to rare-draft a lot though lol YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18weBrcCtyI
