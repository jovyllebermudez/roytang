- [April 22, 2023, 8:41 p.m. Arkham Horror LCG](https://roytang.net/2023/04/arkham-horror-lcg/): Played Arkham Horror LCG at a friend&#x27;s house yesterday. It&#x27;s a coop card game of solving mysteries based on the Cthulhu mythos. We did two scenarios, the first one is The Gathering from the core game which was the intro, and the second one was Curtain Call from the Path to Carcosa. The two scenarios took us around 5hrs of playtime total I think, with a break in between for dinner. We made it through Curtain Call with only one person dying and being traumatized!

The plot of the film is definitely for kids, but that can&#x27;t be avoided as the source material isn&#x27;t exactly deep. A fun romp with lots of references for fans of the Mario franchise in general. Huge improvement over the last film!+ performances by Jack Black and Seth Rogen who were obviously having fun+ Charles Martinet (original Mario voice) playing Mario&#x27;s dad!!+ Peach kicking ass+ the existential Luma lol- not explaining if their last name is Mario
