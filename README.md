I even thought both decks looked decent! Let&#x27;s hope we do better next time!YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv2-HagfZ5k (Click photos to view full-size)

Spoiler-free review: I enjoyed the film, but that might be because I&#x27;m a comics fan anyway and I don&#x27;t care too much about CGI detail (a lot of people seem hung up on that). I liked the humor and the references, I liked the bad guy&#x27;s costume design, was pleasantly surprised by some actors&#x27; being there and was honestly a bit giddy when a certain acronym was first mentioned. That being said, I can understand all the complaints about the film. Character development is definitely not great and some of the returning cast don&#x27;t have a lot

Apparently $44B tech companies are unable to automatically turn off a feature they are planning to take away!

We attended the quiz at a new venue: Hobby Stadium. Rounds were: Pokemon - 7pts (We&#x27;re not really into pokemon, so this is way above our expectations!) NBA - 2pts (Our sports guy hasn&#x27;t been in the country for a long while, so this is about par, maybe a bit below expectation) Magic: The Gathering - 18pts (I confidently used our Joker here, knowing it would be easier than the Marvel round. Annoyed at the key art question that I missed!) Marvel - 7pts (Two of my misses I would
