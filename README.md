Quoted ABSCBNNews&#39;s tweet:   JUST IN: Binawi ng mga pulis ang bangkay ng pinaslang na NDF leader na si Randy Echanis mula sa isang punerarya sa Quezon Avenue; muli itong isinakay sa ambulansya | via @JervisManahan  
- [10 Aug 2020 12:17pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1292797333357248513/): &ldquo;Randy Echanis, 72, &lsquo;was undergoing a medical treatment and unarmed when police forces raided his house,&rsquo; says an Anakpawis colleague&rdquo; - killings aren&rsquo;t unusual here; your headline should at least indicate he was killed by cops @rapplerdotcom
Quoted rapplerdotcom&#39;s tweet:   JUST IN. Longtime peasant leader and activist Randy Echanis was killed inside his own home in Quezon City. https://rappler.com/nation/anakpawis-chair-randy-echanis-killed-inside-quezon-city-home?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1597034184  
- [9 Aug 2020 12:00am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/covid19-08-09/): Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 9 edition:
 So, NCR got sent back into MECQ, a stronger quarantine lockdown. I haven&rsquo;t actually felt the difference, since I&rsquo;m at home most of the time. We went out yesterday for a grocery run, and not much seemed different out there either, still a lot of cars and people out of doors. I don&rsquo;t actually remember what the last MECQ was like, but I kind of assumed things would be closer to how they were at the onset of the lockdowns in March, but this feels still mostly like the GCQ of past weeks.

I feel like he&rsquo;s not too far off from how I say it. There&rsquo;s a lot of things to criticize him about, but this one seems meh. The Yosemite thing was much worse
