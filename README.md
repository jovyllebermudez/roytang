He was fine, I suppose. Tracy probably best Bond girl so far. I liked the ski scenes more than Thunderball&#x27;s underwater scenes. Loose continuity. Was confused by Blofeld not recognizing Bond after they already met in the previous movie. Apparently, the novel order was reversed. Also, did Bond just leave him stuck in a tree assuming he was dead after hunting him relentlessly?
