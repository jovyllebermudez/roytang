- [Feb. 24, 2021, 10:23 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gol1pex/): I do!
- [Feb. 24, 2021, 10:22 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gol1nto/): Unfortunately, I lent out my PS4 copy a while back and can&#x27;t get it back easily now due to some kind of pandemic lol. Also, most of my unlocked last DLC from the last 2 seasons is on Steam now. Would streaming (Netflix, Youtube, etc) interfere with the matching? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m the only one who&#x27;d be doing large downloads in the household, so I can certainly avoid that, but other people are almost always streaming video when I&#x27;d want to be playing.
- [Feb. 24, 2021, 10:20 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gol1cny/): I have a decent fiber connection, something like 60 Mbps down, 45 down, I know that&#x27;s not as good as some countries, but it&#x27;s pretty good for where I am. I guess I&#x27;ll just try lowering my settings though, since the other replies here imply I shouldn&#x27;t be having trouble finding a match. Thanks.
- [Feb. 24, 2021, 10:17 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gol0zxz/): Thanks, just for reference, where in the world are you at?
- [Feb. 24, 2021, 9:58 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/gokyy83/): Wait, so having the icon is good, right? I checked just now and I do have it.
