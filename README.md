- [Feb. 18, 2021, 6:55 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362173871806287872/): Posting publicly for the benefit of other Globe subscribers in Tandang Sora:. @talk2GLOBE seems like 36h (and counting) should be more than enough time to at least give us a estimated timeframe of when we can expect a fix. Is it possibly within the day? Week? Month? Give us some idea so we can plan accordingly, especially for those who need this connection for work or school Almost an hour after I posted this, our internet service has apparently been restored. I hope my fellow tandang sora globe subscribers have recovered as well
