- [19 Sep 2020 11:03am](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1307274008438603776/): @zalthehuman republic acts are laws passed by congress and signed by yhe president. administrative orders are issued by the executive branch as part of his duties and thus limited to the powers of the executive
- [18 Sep 2020 11:18pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/g5r7zk8/): Super annoyed that I have exactly 1340 gems rn lol. (I also have only 5kish gold, so that&rsquo;s not an option either)
- [18 Sep 2020 3:28pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306978449601380356/): Fun fact: Japan uses a predetermined fortune telling calendar thing called Rokuyou (六曜) Six days. Most calendars have the type of day written on them by default. The most lucky day is Taian (大安). Every major PlayStation console launched on a 大安 day in Japan, except one.
- [18 Sep 2020 9:55am](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306894698435375104/): I’ve been alive for 40+ years, I dont think I’ve believed anything in the past that would get me “cancelled” today. (not that I’m worth “cancelling”), so maybe “everyone” is a bit strong
Quoted paulg&#39;s tweet:   Since everyone in the past believed things that would get you cancelled today, the factor that determines whether they&rsquo;ll actually be cancelled is whether or not they happened to publish such beliefs. Which is almost random, but not quite; those who wrote little are safer.
