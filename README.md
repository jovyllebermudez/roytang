- [Oct. 5, 2022, 3:50 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1577566834945298432/): My headcanon is that Vic Rodriguez is out because he kept nagging Jr to get some work done - like the SRA thing - and that TCA is out because she kept asking about how to justify all the partying and other shenanigans. Calida is out probably for being an asshole or sth [15:54] Bersamin knows all of this so he just immediately got to work in making up nonsense to justify the F1 thing in a way that doesn&#x27;t prejudice any future excuse #philippines #politics
- [Oct. 5, 2022, 1:20 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1577529203721142274/): I sometimes think about running a small hole-in-the-wall used bookstore in suburban Metro Manila, the kind where you have maybe 3-4 visitors a day and I spend all day in front of a computer while manning the shop, working on random things. We also buy and sell used PS3 games Quoted anothercohen&#x27;s tweet: I don&#x27;t know a single person who works in tech and hasn&#x27;t seriously thought about quitting and opening up a coffee shop in a small town in the middle of nowhere [13:21] This fantasy falls apart when I remember the bureaucracy involved in starting a business in
- [Oct. 4, 2022, 10:01 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/ir0mbpp/): In case you weren&#x27;t around for previous remaster sets like Kaladesh Remastered, they&#x27;re basically selected cards from all the sets in the block (for this case that would be Shadows Over Innistrad and Eldritch Moon), combined into one draftable booster product. There will likely be drafts or you can just buy the packs from the store or craft the cards with wildcards etc. For Amonkhet Remastered, they also included some reprints from sets outside of the block, but with new flavor/art to match the plane, so that might happen here as well. We don&#x27;t expect new cards that aren&#x27;t reprints
