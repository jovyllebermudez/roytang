Great perfromances here and it&#x27;s a pretty good crime film, with a lot of big names (very young Natalie Portman!)

- [Dec. 18, 2021, 5:28 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/1472136614885269506/): I&#x27;m rank 200 on this list so... :shrug: Quoted proteinkiss&#x27;s tweet: The 2022 version of the Japanese luck calendar came out… the closer your birthday is to the first rank, the luckier you are for next year I’m 291 (oof) and I just want to know y’all’s ranking (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Dec. 18, 2021, 12:43 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/1472064872783384578/): The thing I don&#x27;t understand about the whole BDO hacking thing: the stolen amounts were transferred to a Unionbank account owned by a &quot;Mark Nagoyo&quot;, which is presumably not a real person. But banks are supposed to check client IDs etc, how did that account get past KYC?
