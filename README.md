- [May 25, 2021, 9:02 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/1397176143820722180/): This kind of &quot;data massaging&quot; (ranking not normalized by pop) has harmful effects beyond simply propaganda. What if those DDS who see this become complacent because they think we have vaccinated more than even Singapore? Quoted pnagovph&#x27;s tweet: LOOK: The Philippines ranked second among the countries in Southeast Asia in terms of total doses of #Covid19 vaccines administered.
