But banks are supposed to check client IDs etc, how did that account get past KYC?

- [Dec. 15, 2021, 3:04 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/1471013172479889410/): Everything has to have a year in review nowadays lol. I guess my tendency is to just play one big game a year on the #NintendoSwitch, though next year might be BOTW2 and SMTV. #NintendoSwitch2021 #gaming Quoted NintendoAmerica&#x27;s tweet: As 2021 winds down, itâ€™s time to look back at your year with Nintendo Switch!

- [Dec. 14, 2021, 2:05 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/56dd95663d98892bbe89d56ab0b96887/): Straightforward superhero film, not particularly exceptional or clever or funny or anything, it&#x27;s just there. Surprisingly short runtime, around 1:40. Plot proceeds briskly with very little cruft. They leaned into the &quot;odd couple&quot; trope which isn&#x27;t a thing in the comics. Pleasantly surprised that Shriek is played by Naomie Harris (Moneypenny!). There is a post-credits scene.
