- [Jan. 13, 2021, 2:44 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/kw2qun/): Posted on r/MagicArena: Foretell and Revealed Cards in Hand on Arena I&#x27;m wondering how Arena will handle using Foretell when some of the cards in the opponent&#x27;s hand are revealed to you, since the card you exile with foretell should be hidden information. i.e., if I thoughtseize you and you&#x27;re holding 3 different foretell cards, then during your turn you pay 2 and exile one of them, the other 2 should no longer be revealed to me, since I would be able to deduce which card was exiled. Have they made any statement about this? I&#x27;m not super confident they&#x27;d
