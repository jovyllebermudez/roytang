- [Jan. 6, 2021, 7:08 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1347017186317983745/): I was watching the CNN live feed for around 2hrs in the early morning over here as the insurrection was breaking. It invoked memories of watching the twin towers collapse on the news from half a world away, less than 20 years ago
- [Jan. 6, 2021, 12:53 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1346922745234223104/): Morning coffee. 6/365 #sketchdaily ** I once drew Beast and Spider-man having coffee while upside down and now that I think about it that&#x27;s probably not physically possible for humans lol.
- [Jan. 6, 2021, 2:18 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1346763019800334337/): @secretGeek how to disable this? @secretGeek just checked mine and found it wasn&#x27;t enabled. Probably because I don&#x27;t actually have enough free dropbox space for it lol
- [Jan. 5, 2021, 11:23 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1346718914764369927/): There was no New Year&#x27;s Eve in the Philippines in 1844. The Philippines redrew the International Date Line to simplify trade with its Asian neighbors. As a result, local time in the Philippines jumped from December 30, 1844 to January 1, 1845. https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/in-1844-the-philippines-skipped-a-day-and-it-took-decades-for-the-rest-of-the-world-to-notice
- [Jan. 5, 2021, 10:01 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/gi6ha57/): I can’t relate to this request (I guess because I’m spiky), but I’m always curious whenever this comes up: are there other ccgs that do this (having systems that reward things other than winning, aside from daily quests)?
