- [16 Jul 2020 9:18am](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1283692366520446978/): Quoted ABSCBNNews&#39;s tweet:   A college student was subpoenaed by the NBI Cybercrime Division for sharing a post critical of Sen. Bong Go. The student’s lawyer declined to be interviewed but confirmed that it was the senator’s lawyers who filed the complaint. | via @Nikobaua  
- [15 Jul 2020 3:53pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/b74a3432dfd7293ec59730ff16e66151/): I just said &ldquo;Okay, screw you NPM!&rdquo; out loud.
- [15 Jul 2020 7:58am](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1283309985632378880/): hindi natin kaya mag &ldquo;mass testing&rdquo;
  &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; ang president sa ABS-CBN shutdown
  we acted &ldquo;early&rdquo; in response to the pandemic
  &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; pa ang president
  we have already &ldquo;flattened&rdquo; the curve
  Same energy.
- [15 Jul 2020 3:09am](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1283237290664292359/): If the ABS CBN shutdown was actually good for the nation, why is the president&rsquo;s spokesman insistent on pretending he is neutral about it? Ever heard of a politician refusing to take credit for a good thing?
Quoted ANCALERTS&#39;s tweet:   Presidential spokesman Harry Roque maintained that Duterte remains &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; on ABS-CBN and did not have a hand in its failed franchise application bid despite the President&rsquo;s fresh tirades against the embattled media giant in a recording of his speech reported by the Inquirer.
- [14 Jul 2020 10:53pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1283172770377940992/): I must confess, I don&rsquo;t understand what &ldquo;anti-cancel culture&rdquo; people hope to accomplish. Do they think we should not be allowed to dislike other people&rsquo;s opinions?
