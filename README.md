- [March 27, 2021, 8:15 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/03/1375783440952397832/): @SaffronOlive Wait, are bolt counterspell and swords allowed in historic brawl then?
- [March 27, 2021, 5:10 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/03/1375737016407625729/): Planning for a stricter lockdown less than a week after starting this ridiculous bubble, without even waiting to see the effects, reeks of making shit up as they go along, just reacting to the numbers without any real analysis or planning.
- [March 27, 2021, 10:29 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/03/1375636032448696323/): It always feels weird for me when the PH president exercises a line item veto, since presumably Congress has balanced the bill as a whole. This is an unusual power, Wikipedia only lists 3-4 countries that allow line item vetoes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto Quoted manilabulletin&#x27;s tweet: READ: President Duterte vetoed nine items in CREATE law, including hike in VAT threshold on real property sale, redundant incentives for domestic enterprises; automatic approval of incentive application (ðŸ“·: Roque) | @GenKabiling Note that the PH isn&#x27;t one of those listed in the Wikipedia article! I think I&#x27;ll attempt to edit Wikipedia today.
