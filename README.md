- [13 Aug 2020 3:24pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/8de9468cf4538aa076962780946b5066/): I had some complaints about the latter half of the season, but I liked how they resolved their timey-wimey business. Agents of SHIELD had a great run and a pretty good series finale
- [12 Aug 2020 6:43pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1293619088120410113/): Why is SFxT not available on Steam in SEA?
- [12 Aug 2020 6:24pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g18o8f5/): sent you a friend request
- [12 Aug 2020 5:42pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g18ibyv/): wait the servers are going down?
