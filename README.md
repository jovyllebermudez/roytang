- [Feb. 28, 2023, 1:05 a.m. Phyrexia All Will Be One Quick Drafts 1 and 2](https://roytang.net/2023/02/mtgone-quickdrafts/): Wasn&#x27;t sure if I could stream before #MTGONE quick drafts rotated out, so I decided to do a couple offline. Only went 3 and 4, which is still a bit better than my last draft day. I won every game with that Sword, but I never got to cast Kaya.

I even thought both decks looked decent! Let&#x27;s hope we do better next time!YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv2-HagfZ5k (Click photos to view full-size)
