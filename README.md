- [Dec. 31, 2020, 3:33 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344788913697669120/): Since I do Google Takeout on a regular basis, it would be nice if they had an option to generate a delta export since the last one, instead of making me download 100+ gigs everytime
- [Dec. 31, 2020, 8:04 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344675891784212485/): Andami pa ding paputok
- [Dec. 31, 2020, 5:41 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344639767586041861/): #medianoche is early this year as well. Happy new year!
- [Dec. 31, 2020, 2:38 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344593852154347520/): Last-minute mythic on #magicarena to close out the year. #mtg Eternal is close to Master Rank too, but I don&#x27;t think I have the energy for it. Honestly, grinding to Mythic takes too much time, so maybe I won&#x27;t push it so hard in 2021. Or maybe just in December lol
