- [Oct. 26, 2022, 7:50 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1585237402192601089/): After SIX YEARS of playing #StreetFighterV, I finally managed to get to gold rank!! Nothing -&gt; Silver: 5 years (!!) Silver -&gt; Super Silver: 14 months Super Silver -&gt; Ultra Silver: 5 months Ultra Silver -&gt; Gold: 7 days!! (Click photos to view full-size) [19:50] The only SFV achievement left for me is the 300 super finishes one, at least now I don&#x27;t have to focus on winning so much! Hopefully we get to completion before SF6 comes out!
- [Oct. 26, 2022, 1:29 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/catch-me/): Watched Catch Me If You Can last night. Actually over two nights. Been meaning to see this for a while, it looked neat. Frank Abagnale&#x27;s capers are largely entertaining, though the narration does feel heavily exaggerated in favor of the protagonist (and reading through Abagnale&#x27;s wikipedia entry suggests so as well).

- [Oct. 23, 2022, 8:30 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/black-adam/): Enjoyed Black Adam, despite the poor critic reviews. The plot isn&#x27;t anything spectacular, but it&#x27;s a fun romp and good for comic fans. Was very happy to be correct that the actress playing Adrianna was Shaw from Person of Interest! She should have gotten higher billing. Brosnan gave a great performance as Fate. The VFX guys really loved Cyclone. Atom Smasher probably my favorite of the JSA crew. The Rock maximizing the use of his one &quot;smoldering&quot; look. Viola Davis, Jennifer Holland, Djimon Hounsou, and [surprise mid-credits actor cameo] reprising roles were welcome surprises. The only character I didn&#x27;t actually
