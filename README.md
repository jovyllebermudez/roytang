- [Jan. 14, 2023, 11:44 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/letterboxd-review-339378547/): I like this new CGI animation style, everything looks cool. The plot is pretty by the numbers for a DC thing, but the banter between the boys is great.

The film alternates between light-hearted moments and gut-wrenching conflict. The script
