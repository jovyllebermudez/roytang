- [Dec. 31, 2020, 2:38 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344593852154347520/): Last-minute mythic on #magicarena to close out the year. #mtg Eternal is close to Master Rank too, but I don&#x27;t think I have the energy for it. Honestly, grinding to Mythic takes too much time, so maybe I won&#x27;t push it so hard in 2021. Or maybe just in December lol
- [Dec. 31, 2020, 1:37 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344578492143341568/): @rovietoosin but... it&#x27;s not Chinese New year
- [Dec. 30, 2020, 10:50 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344355074722578433/): Apparently I was suspected of being a robot.
- [Dec. 30, 2020, 5:11 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344269903285473283/): I thought my PC had died earlier today, but I was somehow able to resurrect it. Here&#x27;s hoping this machine outlasts the pandemic somehow
