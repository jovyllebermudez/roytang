- [Nov. 5, 2022, 3:16 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/boardgame-day/): Met up with my oldest friend group yesterday to play boardgames and MTG in honor of a friend who passed away. Some notes on the games we played: Cosmic Encounter Cosmic Encounter is a fun little space game where the goal is to put your ships on enemy planets, either through attacks or negotiations. Each encounter is relatively simple and resolves quickly; you choose a target and you either fight or negotiate, and each player plays a card to further that objective. Spicing it up is that each player is assigned a special power which is hidden at the start

It’s just a way of living. It has to do with paying attention, remembering, filtering what you see and answering back, participating in life. – Viggo Mortensen
