- [April 21, 2021, 5:28 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1384801237372219392/): Wednesday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #strixhaven Had a great draft! I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!

The quintessential sports film, but I&#x27;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.
