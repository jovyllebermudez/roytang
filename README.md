- [Oct. 12, 2022, 5:26 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/109151752766558627/): Aight, so notes on migrating to a new Mastodon instance: I found the ff helpful: https://edtechfactotum.com/migrating-to-a-new-mastodon-home/ I was able to successfully create the alias to the old account on this new account, so the bug mentioned in the above is already fixed. However, I was unable to create the redirect from the old account (&quot;is not an alias of this account&quot;). Looks like a cache invalidation issue (https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/12216), I&#x27;ll try again in a couple of days I guess [2022-10-14 05:24] Update: finally got @roytang@mastodon.technology and @roytang@mastodon.social to redirect here. Apparently that results in a bunch of notifs as your followers
