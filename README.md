- [Jan. 21, 2021, 11:04 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1352089564244938754/): I see some people posting like &quot;why are you all excited about biden, the US is still going to be imperialist/not progressive enough/whatever&quot; and i&#x27;m like ugh sure whatever, lots of room for improvement still, but did you actually prefer trump? The US just kicked out a racist, misogynistic, egocentric sociopath president, let them enjoy that for a little bit maybe? There&#x27;s no shortage of people willing to push their admin for reforms either.

- [Jan. 20, 2021, 12:17 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1351745725428768769/): PRRD said that its unfair that only UP &amp; PUP have a pact... I completely agree!!!! So why not enter into a similar pact with ALL THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES or, better yet, pass a law that will guaramtee this to ALL UNIVERSITIES instead of abrogating these two. #TrustTheFilipinoYouth
