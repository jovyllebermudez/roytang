- [Feb. 23, 2021, 6:01 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1364153348023226368/): I think #MagicArena should have a random deck mode. You queue up, you get paired, it chooses one of the decks in your collection at random (any format), you don&#x27;t know which until your mulligan decision. (People with &lt; 10 decks get starter decks added to their pool)

- [Feb. 23, 2021, 3:49 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363939008481353729/): TIL that opossums are not the same as possums #sketchdaily 53/365

- [Feb. 22, 2021, 4:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363765401742569474/): Time to (re)mix it up! This pixel perfect adventure is one you don’t want to miss. Your browser does not support the video tag.
