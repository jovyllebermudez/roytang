There seems to be a problem with Firefox though, the button for sharing results doesn&#x27;t appear (see screenshot). I only saw the buttonn when i tried it in edge (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Jan. 28, 2023, 9:49 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/109767149280055955/): @prijks I am surprised this format (with the content warning) works with the bot, I hadn&#x27;t handled it explicitly! Thanks for helping test!
- [Jan. 28, 2023, 9:36 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/the-menu-2022/): This was very, very good. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect; I thought it was going to be some stabby serial-killer thing, but the whole black comedy vibe and the rising tension were executed very well. Ralph Fiennes gives an excellent performance as the chef delivering the menu.
