- [Aug. 23, 2023, 11:52 p.m. Movies: Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)](https://roytang.net/2023/08/lupin-the-third-the-castle-of-cagliostro-1979/): I haven&#x27;t actually seen a lot of Lupin III, I mostly watched this because it was Miyazaki&#x27;s directorial debut. As such I didn&#x27;t expect much but it was a fun, enjoyable and well-animated romp.

- [Aug. 23, 2023, 12:34 a.m. Movies: Street Kings (2008)](https://roytang.net/2023/08/street-kings-2008/): Watched this one just because it was in the NF top 10. Action and suspense were fine, but it&#x27;s hard to be supportive or sympathetic towards the protags when everyone is a dirty cop. Mastermind was kind of obvious early on. House and Sgt Jeffords are here!
