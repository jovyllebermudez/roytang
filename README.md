- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:25 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576911381135519745/): This past weekend I participated in Ludum Dare 51 (https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51)! A full blog post is probably coming in a day or so, but you can go ahead and play my submission at https://hungryroy.itch.io/10-second-pizza-delivery (It might be a bit hard)
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:18 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576909576313528320/): Managed to hit Master rank in Throne on @EternalCardGame last month, and even tried to go for rank 1, but my deck got nerfed towards the end of the month lol. I think I got to 14 at best and ended at 25. Too bad they don&#x27;t seem to be publishing the eom leaderboards anymore. (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:07 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576906681661161474/): The only thing this would expose would be a lack of understanding of how most people don&#x27;t actually choose lotto numbers randomly. Quoted gmanews&#x27;s tweet: Senate Minority Leader Aquilino &quot;Koko&quot; Pimentel III on Sunday said he would file a resolution seeking an investigation into how 433 bettors won the P236 million PCSO Grand Lotto jackpot. https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/846706/pimentel-to-seek-senate-probe-on-433-bettors-winning-the-pcso-grand-lotto/story/
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 7:55 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576903743593140225/): I think I do. Can I give it a shot? It has to do with the purpose of government. For some people (like us) purpose of government is to help people. We think fairness is possible, and that the government&#x27;s job is to try to create fairness. Others have a different worldview. 1/ https://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1556372038008332290
