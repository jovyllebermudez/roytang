- [Oct. 4, 2022, 10:01 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/ir0mbpp/): In case you weren&#x27;t around for previous remaster sets like Kaladesh Remastered, they&#x27;re basically selected cards from all the sets in the block (for this case that would be Shadows Over Innistrad and Eldritch Moon), combined into one draftable booster product. There will likely be drafts or you can just buy the packs from the store or craft the cards with wildcards etc. For Amonkhet Remastered, they also included some reprints from sets outside of the block, but with new flavor/art to match the plane, so that might happen here as well. We don&#x27;t expect new cards that aren&#x27;t reprints

- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:25 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576911381135519745/): This past weekend I participated in Ludum Dare 51 (https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51)! A full blog post is probably coming in a day or so, but you can go ahead and play my submission at https://hungryroy.itch.io/10-second-pizza-delivery (It might be a bit hard)
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:18 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576909576313528320/): Managed to hit Master rank in Throne on @EternalCardGame last month, and even tried to go for rank 1, but my deck got nerfed towards the end of the month lol. I think I got to 14 at best and ended at 25. Too bad they don&#x27;t seem to be publishing the eom leaderboards anymore. (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Oct. 3, 2022, 8:07 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1576906681661161474/): The only thing this would expose would be a lack of understanding of how most people don&#x27;t actually choose lotto numbers randomly. Quoted gmanews&#x27;s tweet: Senate Minority Leader Aquilino &quot;Koko&quot; Pimentel III on Sunday said he would file a resolution seeking an investigation into how 433 bettors won the P236 million PCSO Grand Lotto jackpot. https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/846706/pimentel-to-seek-senate-probe-on-433-bettors-winning-the-pcso-grand-lotto/story/
