- [Aug. 22, 2023, 12:56 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/08/15xd8r5/): Posted on r/comicbooks: I&#x27;ve had this Daredevil image saved for a while, is it from an actual comic?!?
- [Aug. 21, 2023, 11:58 p.m. Movies: Young Frankenstein (1974)](https://roytang.net/2023/08/young-frankenstein-1974/): My dad wanted to see this so I ended up watching it too. I remember seeing bits and pieces of this from when I was young, like the lead wanting his last name to be pronounced differently. There are a lot of wink wink bawdy jokes that I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten as a kid though. Good for a few laughs. The monster was Everybody Loves Raymond&#x27;s dad!

- [Aug. 16, 2023, 11:19 p.m. GeekFight: Hobby Stadium Select!](https://roytang.net/2023/08/geekfight-select/): Pokemon - 0pts Wrestling - 1pt Magic the Gathering - 7pts (x2 for joker!) NBA - 5pts Harry Potter - 4/5pts (not sure) One Piece - 6pts I originally didn&#x27;t want to go to this one because the categories seemed quite hard, as evidenced by our terrible first two rounds, but somehow we managed to stage a comeback and to finish tied for first place at 31pts!
