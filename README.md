- [Dec. 5, 2020, 2:33 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1335170496153841664/): @visakanv It kind of bothers me that the first tweet in that thread says “2019 tweets”. I know that refers to the quoted 2019 thread, but you otherwise typically start your threads with context for the rest of the thread
