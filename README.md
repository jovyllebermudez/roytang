- [June 11, 2023, 7:37 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/06/110525378489097432/): Huh, the indieweb,.social web UI has changed. How can I move this posting form back to the leftmost column?
- [June 6, 2023, 11:41 p.m. Movies: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/06/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-2023/): A fantastic follow-up to the original 2018 movie, further developing Miles and expanding on Gwen&#x27;s back story as well. Fantastic use of animation not only to portray the different universes, but as also as a storytelling tool to convey emotion, tone and depth. Also I must commend the marketing for preparing trailers that while they showed a lot of the fun stuff in the films, never spoiled any of the deeper plot moments or the cause of the ultimate conflict that arises between Miles and the other Spiders. Looking forward to Beyond the Spider-verse next year!
- [June 5, 2023, 1:18 a.m. Movies: The Mummy (1999)](https://roytang.net/2023/06/the-mummy-1999/): When I told my friends I&#x27;d never seen this film before they told me it&#x27;s fun so I watched it. It was indeed fun, but not as fun as I&#x27;d hoped and I feel like my expectations were set too high. I think I was expecting more Indiana Jones type hijinx and instead got body horror and cheesy 90s CGI.That being said, still very entertaining; Fraser and Weiss gave good performances that prevented the movie from being too cheesy. I like how the protag starts out rough and a bit belligerent but comes around to show he really cares about
- [June 3, 2023, 11:19 p.m. More Boardgames](https://roytang.net/2023/06/boardgames/): Met up with some friends for boardgames TWICE this week! One of our playgroup is flying back to the US next week so we won&#x27;t be able to play together in person for a while so we took the opportunity to play as much as we can. Earlier in the week, we finally managed to finish the Path to Carcosa campaign of Arkham Horror card game. We just barely made it out scenario 7 alive, but scenario 8 was a bit easier. Overall the game is fun and interesting and challenging, but you really need a regular playgroup to go
