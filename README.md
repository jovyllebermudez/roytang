- [18 Sep 2020 3:28pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306978449601380356/): Fun fact: Japan uses a predetermined fortune telling calendar thing called Rokuyou (六曜) Six days. Most calendars have the type of day written on them by default. The most lucky day is Taian (大安). Every major PlayStation console launched on a 大安 day in Japan, except one.
- [18 Sep 2020 9:55am](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306894698435375104/): I’ve been alive for 40+ years, I dont think I’ve believed anything in the past that would get me “cancelled” today. (not that I’m worth “cancelling”), so maybe “everyone” is a bit strong
Quoted paulg&#39;s tweet:   Since everyone in the past believed things that would get you cancelled today, the factor that determines whether they&rsquo;ll actually be cancelled is whether or not they happened to publish such beliefs. Which is almost random, but not quite; those who wrote little are safer.
- [18 Sep 2020 4:32am](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306813354720333824/): Zendikar Rising draft! ep1 (contd) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgzkr
- [17 Sep 2020 8:27pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306691161415847936/): @TheZvi Maintenance has been extended. https://magicthegatheringarena.statuspage.io/ Probably better to wait for a while than trying stuff again
- [17 Sep 2020 5:45pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306650526990376960/): Zendikar Rising draft! ep1 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgzkn
So I managed to play one game (and lost) before server-related issues. Will continue later, but here&rsquo;s my draft deck
I managed to play 2 drafts during this episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2rcdcJSloo
Unfortunately (spoiler!) I performed very poorly D: Have to figure out what I&rsquo;m doing wrong (aside from the obvious misplays), feel free to give feedback!
2nd draft deck (BG):
