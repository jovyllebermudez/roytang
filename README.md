 Watching mass via Facebook again today. The nearby Church actually holds services, but last I heard it was only 10 people per mass, and need to call ahead of time. It doesn&rsquo;t seem likely we&rsquo;ll be going anytime soon. grocery run yesterday, without incident last Thursday I finally got a haircut my last one was around New Year&rsquo;s Day, so this was around six and a half months of hair cut off.
