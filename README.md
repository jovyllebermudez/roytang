I didn&#x27;t help a lot with this one after the initial framing. Also, my mom insists the structures on top are ruined buildings, I can&#x27;t convince her they&#x27;re some kind of red rock formations.

- [May 6, 2023, 1:38 p.m. Movies: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-2023/): Feels like this had a darker, more somber and much more emotional tone than the first two films. A very hateable villain, especially for animal lovers. The Guardians crew are at the best they&#x27;ve ever been; the banter and the coordination fighting alongside each other are a testament of how they&#x27;ve grown together as a found family. The films gives a fitting end to the story arcs for most of our Guardians crew.Some plot nitpicks here and there, and my brother though the film was just a tad too long, but nothing too problematic. James Gunn has more or less
