- [Oct. 7, 2022, 3:43 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/109125868390603935/): Oh no, just found out mastodon.technology is shutting down =/ No wonder I got a number of re-follows from migrated accounts today. Time to once again play the game of &quot;What if I just make my custom blog software Mastodon compatible?&quot;

- [Oct. 5, 2022, 3:50 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/1577566834945298432/): My headcanon is that Vic Rodriguez is out because he kept nagging Jr to get some work done - like the SRA thing - and that TCA is out because she kept asking about how to justify all the partying and other shenanigans. Calida is out probably for being an asshole or sth [15:54] Bersamin knows all of this so he just immediately got to work in making up nonsense to justify the F1 thing in a way that doesn&#x27;t prejudice any future excuse #philippines #politics
