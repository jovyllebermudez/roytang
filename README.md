- [Sept. 11, 2023, 10:35 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/09/111047010694586246/): Almost forgot to log the #mtgarenastats email for #MTGLTR that I got a couple of days ago. This was a very low-yield set for me especially in terms of boosters opened since I did not play much limited for this season. Hopefully we do much better with Wilds of Eldraine! #mtg #magicarena (Click photos to view full-size)

As usual, I start off with a sealed first to get a feel for the set, and happily our very first sealed got us a trophy! #mtg #mtgwoe #magicarena (Click photos to view full-size)
