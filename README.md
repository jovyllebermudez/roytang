- [Dec. 2, 2021, 1:50 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/fb592c3df5beb43afd534ed11e76280c/): So a friend got his booster shot around lunch time and said there weren&#x27;t a lot of people and it only took 20 mins. So I checked and saw I could still book a slot for 3PM at SM North and I was like why not, if it&#x27;s only 20 minutes? FAM I WAS THERE FOR 3.5 HOURS THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE. I forgot that today was the last day of the National Vaccination drive or whatever it&#x27;s called. Rewarded myself afterwards with some Pepper Lunch, first time back at a mall since March 2020!

- [Dec. 1, 2021, 8:20 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/1466019368119291910/): Crimson Vow drafting! ep 8 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgcrimson [22:27] Only got to play one draft today. Unfortunately the pattern of alternating good and bad days did not hold up and this draft was a bit meh. Probably my fault because of bad keeps though. Deck seemed pretty solid.
