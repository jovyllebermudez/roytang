Only read the book in 2014, but I can hardly remember the plot except for the broad strokes. Movie is pretty good though; a reasonable adaptation of a supposedly &quot;unfilmable&quot; book. Arrakis is pretty close to how I imagined it in my head. The sandworms look great. Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, and Timothee Chalamet gave pretty good performances. Ending might be weird if you didn&#x27;t know it was a two-parter going in. Looking forward to the next movie.
