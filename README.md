The GP shirts were always a bit too small for me, so my dad is the one who has been wearing mine all this time. #mtg #gpmanila
- [Feb. 13, 2023, 12:34 a.m. Movies: Lost Bullet (2020)](https://roytang.net/2023/02/lost-bullet-2020/): I think I got a recommendation for Lost Bullet 2 from somewhere and decided to watch this one first since it was also on NF. Didn&#x27;t know anything coming in other than it&#x27;s some kind of Fast and the Furious-type thing, and I&#x27;ve never seen any of those films. Surprised to find out it&#x27;s actually a French film. Switched to French voices with English subs because the English dubs in live action really throws me off. The plot isn&#x27;t that original and kinda predictable and there were actually not as many car chases than I thought there would be, but
