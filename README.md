- [Nov. 28, 2022, 4:16 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/b9e4f1f1a5363c0476fb65e7ab1b8ada/): I haven&#x27;t been doing any daily sketching, but I do have this piece of paper full of doodles on my desk that I&#x27;ve just been adding to slowly over the past couple of weeks.
- [Nov. 27, 2022, 4:12 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/arena-open/): Threw away some gold and gems on two runs at the Arena Open this past weekend, featuring Brothers War sealed. Finished 5-3 and 2-3 respectively. I really should just remember to never do a second run, they never go well! Resources are limited! Got some cool Mythics and Rares though.
- [Nov. 26, 2022, 5:49 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/701960599133913088/): Iâ€™ve been looking for this Pugad Baboy strip for a while, mostly so I can respond to people who are Pilosopo
- [Nov. 24, 2022, 8:30 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/popquiz-friendsgiving/): Final PopQuiz for the year! Rounds were: Live Action TV - 6pts Movies - 7pts x 0 for failed ace Naruto - 8pts x2 for powerup Animated TV - 3pts Video and Board Games - 4pts Fictional Bands (audio round) - 7pts (out of 20) The Naruto round was chosen by us as a benefit of placing third last month. We had originally submitted House of the Dragon as the topic, but we later found out our HotD person wouldn&#x27;t be available, so we switched it out. Despite the poor performance and disastrous ace usage, we still managed to finish
- [Nov. 22, 2022, 5:11 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/1594981838841270272/): Drafting Brothers War on #MagicArena! ep3 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgbro [21:13] Third draft day went slightly better than the previous days. Managed a 3 and a 6 respectively. I thought the first draft deck was better but the second one got more wins. Am I doomed to always go WB? At least I made fewer misplays today!
