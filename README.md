- [June 24, 2021, 9:26 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1408053878579294208/): RIP Former President Noynoy Aquino.

- [June 24, 2021, 5:03 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/7d38789afe70956e56d61914ed7d195a/): Watched A View To A Kill (1985), Bond film no. 14. Moore is showing his age, luckily this is his last entry. Very 80s theme song by Duran Duran. Christopher Walken is here, as a Bond villain with a plan straight out of Superman (1978). Tanya Roberts plays a young Bond girl just 14 years before playing a middle-aged mom on That 70s Show. Random young Dolph Lundgren cameo! Kind of a ridiculous street chase scene through San Francisco. Overall not the best of Moore&#x27;s run.
- [June 23, 2021, 11:13 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1407718570935476225/): when the pandemic ends and we can all see each other again, everyone should wear new outfits and have new abilities so that it feels like an anime timeskip
