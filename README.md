- [Oct. 5, 2023, 11:04 p.m. Movies: Blue Beetle (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/10/blue-beetle-2023/): This one was okay, had a lot of heart, though I feel like we see the &quot;family&quot; theme in superhero films a bit too often. I was kind of expecting some kind of involvement from Beetle&#x27;s alien origins, but I guess that can be saved for sequels, if we get any.

- [Oct. 4, 2023, 11:24 p.m. Movies: Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/10/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-2023/): Slightly better than I expected it to be, probably in the upper half for the live-action series overall. They are at least getting better at having the different robots distinguishable from each other (mostly through more prominent metal coloring on each one), though the entire movie went by without telling us the names of Scourge&#x27;s two goons. Big messy CGI fight at the end though.Wikipedia says this one is supposed to be both a sequel to Bumblebee (2018) and a prequel to Transformers (2007), but there&#x27;s no way that makes sense continuity-wise.
