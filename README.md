- [April 16, 2023, 5:52 p.m. Movies: Surrogates (2009)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/surrogates-2009/): I remember seeing the trailer for this one back in the day and thought it might be interesting. I was wrong. There was one decent action sequence in there but the rest of the film was forgettable.I also have trouble with the idea that the use of surrogates is so widespread that homicides are unheard of, yet there are these large anti-surrogate reservations right next to the big cities where the residents all look like homeless people. Also surely only middle class and up are able to afford surrogates, so does the rest of society just live in these dread

Fresh, fun and witty adventure, and so many references for those familiar with the source material. I liked the Paladin and the Druid, but all the characters are quite good and reasonably fleshed out and likeable and the performances are pretty good. This is what I wish MCU movies could be like since Endgame.
- [April 12, 2023, 10:36 p.m. Geekfight Then Now Forever](https://roytang.net/2023/04/geekfight-then-now-forever/): We came back to GeekFight looking for revenge, but our (my) D&amp;D and WWE knowledge fell short. Rounds were: Returns and Revivals - 8pts Adapted Works - 16pts (Joker) D&amp;D - 4pts. Miserable, especially since if we were thinking straight we might have managed as high as a 7 here Music - 3pts. Their selection of mashups and covers continues to confound us Sequels and Spinoffs - 6pts WWE - 2pts. Lol this went about as well as I expected. At least we managed to tie for 2nd this time, within striking distance of the winning team, an improvement from
