Probably won&#x27;t have the full episode on YT (maybe just the last few matches). But spoiler alert: I was able to break my unlucky streak with some Quandrix + Prismari goodness! I might also get reimbursed lol. Last couple of matches on YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuXcPVm0YQ Okay, I was able to record the draft itself locally, so this draft has two videos. In order: Part 1 (draft): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skUg-kWzq_g Part 2 (last few matches): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuXcPVm0YQ
