My problem with it is that connecting the charger to the device via the Magsafe port is super finicky, most of the time if I just plug it in straight, the device won&#x27;t charge (the battery status indicator will have the lightning bolt symbol, but if you click on it, the dropdown will say &quot;not charging&quot;) and the magsafe connector won&#x27;t light up (if it&#x27;s charging it will light up either red or green).
