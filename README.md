- [April 29, 2022, 5:01 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1519965030430687238/): Playing some Streets of New Capenna Sealed! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgsnc [20:51] Well, SNC limited season is off to a terrible start! I did two sealed runs, each one only went 1-3 =/ Got to learn this format quickly! (Three sealed pools shown because after two losses, I decided to YOLO the first pool and try 4 color) YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hLqAswzobM (Click photos to view full-size)
- [April 29, 2022, 12:45 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1519900570538049536/): #MagicArena stats for #mtgneo have dropped! Apparently I haven&#x27;t hit mythic constructed in a while. I managed to open more packs this time around though. #mtgarenastats (Click photos to view full-size)
- [April 27, 2022, 9:41 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1519310746986762240/): Last-two-weeks-before-elections thoughts: It&#x27;s a mistake to look at the large rally attendance numbers or all the #LeniKiko support in our feeds and conclude something like &quot;The surveys must be wrong&quot; or &quot;We are winning&quot;! #philippines #politics [21:41] Celebrate the wins, sure, but don&#x27;t let it spread to overconfidence. Just because the Marcos supporters are less enthusiastic or visible doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have the numbers. There is still a lot of fight to be fought. [21:41] More than the rally attendance numbers (which is driven mostly by people already committed to the cause), the house-to-house and person-to-person campaigning are more
- [April 27, 2022, 7:57 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1519284554225577985/): One of the Wonder Twins turns into a bucket of water just so Aquaman can be splashed lol Justice League (2018) no. 65 #comicbooks (Click photos to view full-size)
- [April 27, 2022, 7:25 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/04/1519276602827620352/): I dont browse the main timeline that often anymore, mostly because there’s threads like this talking about how Marcos supporters think and the sheer disregard for the common good always depresses me. That being said, that quote could be a good anti-Marcos slogan lol Quoted Javiercrombie&#x27;s tweet: The conversation ended disturbingly, with him saying, in a conyo accent, “Honestly, if you don’t care about the poor or businesses or human rights and shit, then Marcos won’t be that bad.” I walked away pondering what it was like to live a life not caring about anything.
