- [Dec. 29, 2021, 12:47 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/1475870985391849479/): I heard there was free vintage cube on #mtgo so I figured I&#x27;d dust off the old account and give it a shot. I had no idea what I was doing! It&#x27;s a miracle I was able to eke out even one win, and that was only because the opponent timed out just as he was about to win game 3.

Description suggested it would be some kind of action movie. It was most certainly not. The movie is captivating, unsettling, ambiguous, and even kind of trippy. Some great shots and visuals. Also it is surprisingly a Christmas movie. And there is a short post-credits scene!
