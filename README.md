Latest notes:

- [May 25, 2023, 1:13 p.m. Movies: Mystic River (2003)](https://roytang.net/2023/05/mystic-river-2003/): I forget why I added this to my list but wow such a good film with magnificent performances. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were great in this, and even a lot of the supporting cast were great. A dark and tragic tale of loss and trauma and vengeance and endless cycles of violence
- [May 24, 2023, 6:19 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/05/110420318576923027/): So apprently the Twitter API keys my site uses for automated syndication/cross-posting to twitter have stopped working sometime over the past 24h. No warning or anything. Unsurprising given everything else happening over there I guess. Will give it a few days before I just completely disable the crossposting
- [May 23, 2023, 12:13 p.m. Movies: The Raid (2011)](https://roytang.net/2023/05/the-raid-2011/): Intense and action-packed, great fight scenes
- [May 22, 2023, 7:20 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/05/1fd9747948ac89ddedf4fc5778d54680/): Finally unboxing this Breath of the Wild amiibo I bought six years ago so I could use it with Tears of the Kingdom. Looks great! #zelda #amiibo #gaming
- [May 21, 2023, 1:22 p.m. More MOM drafting](https://roytang.net/2023/05/momdrafts/): I&#x27;m not streaming March of the Machine drafts anymore, but I did do some drafting online this past week, in prep for potentially playing in this weekend&#x27;s Arena Open. (Spoiler: I did not end up playing the open.) First up, I actually tried drafting on MTGO! It has been a long while - in fact I have no idea when I last played a game on MTGO, though I do login to check the account occasionally. When I checked my account, I saw that I actually had enough play points to enter a draft league, which I had never done
