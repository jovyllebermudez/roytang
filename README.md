- [June 4, 2021, 3:42 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400719659335229441/): My favorite story about the face shield requirement is that early in the pandemic, a friend couldnt get into the grocery because he didnt have a face shield, so he just stuck a sandwich bag to his face and they let him in He eventually needed to get a face shield because he didn&#x27;t want to make more sandwiches
- [June 4, 2021, 10:04 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400634591166156805/): Binged thru S5 of Kim&#x27;s Convenience yesterday. Still so easy to background-watch. Too bad it&#x27;s the final season, they still had a few open threads to resolve. https://www.avclub.com/simu-liu-opens-up-about-his-anger-and-unhappiness-over-1847022561 Apparently there&#x27;s a planned spinoff starring Shannon, who&#x27;s the second-worst character on the show! WTH. (Worst character is Janet lol)
- [June 4, 2021, 9:09 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400620815381524480/): Not a fan of the how the active tab renders in the new version of Firefox. that doesn&#x27;t look like a tab!
- [June 4, 2021, 12:23 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400488388902326274/): Sunken treasure #sketchdaily 154/365
- [June 3, 2021, 1:11 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1400137937212248065/): If you are old enough, remember when the internet was shiny and new and we all thought it would be the cure for stupidity because everyone would have access to the world’s information at the click of a mouse? How wrong we were.
