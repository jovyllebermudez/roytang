- [Sept. 14, 2023, 6:59 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/09/111063148374230519/): Once again, drafting some more Wilds of Eldraine https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgwoe #twitch [2023-09-15 19:28] Draft no. 6 (WR) went well (6-3), but draft 7 (RGb) was terrible (1-3). YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT7mbEwLPpUNot sure if I&#x27;m ready, but looking forward to the Arena Open this weekend! (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Sept. 12, 2023, 7:43 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/09/111051999172848625/): Drafting some more Wilds of Eldraine https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgwoe #twitch [2023-09-14 07:15] Day 2 of drafting did not go as well as day 1; premier draft 3 (BR) 4 (UR) only got to 3 and 2 respectively.YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzPPWJW4ZLoDraft 4 had the client hang on me in the last match, which let me get reimbursement for my entry fee. Last night I promptly wasted that gold on an off-stream draft 5 where I experimented with a different RB build and did poorly, going 1-3. I wasn&#x27;t even able to save the decklist!Hoping for some good drafts before the open this
- [Sept. 11, 2023, 10:35 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/09/111047010694586246/): Almost forgot to log the #mtgarenastats email for #MTGLTR that I got a couple of days ago. This was a very low-yield set for me especially in terms of boosters opened since I did not play much limited for this season. Hopefully we do much better with Wilds of Eldraine! #mtg #magicarena (Click photos to view full-size)
