- [Dec. 29, 2020, 11:58 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344191049963425795/): Finally watched #WonderWoman1984. Maybe don&#x27;t think too much about what&#x27;s going on in the movie. My headcanon is that the only reason it takes place in 1984 is because it&#x27;s pre-crisis
- [Dec. 29, 2020, 5:11 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/c12b1185667d4adc5a2c99224584a981/): The circle of life: I want to do so many things - things cost time - I don&#x27;t have enough time - I don&#x27;t want to prioritize the things, I want to do them all - I end up just going to sleep
- [Dec. 26, 2020, 6:17 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1342836877942931456/): @Westraid Merry Christmas!
- [Dec. 25, 2020, 2:29 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1342417270094479360/): @wrongwaygoback the token can&#x27;t be used for quick draft or for arena cube
- [Dec. 24, 2020, 6:20 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/ggvzbuq/): For people like me who dislike watching videos: Before you start drafting a set, craft all the common/uncommon cards from the new set, so that each common/uncommon you open in draft adds to the vault percentage.
