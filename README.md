- [April 30, 2023, 4:17 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/04/1652587980337610752/): Managed to salvage Mythic rank for this #magicarena season on the last day using Chris Tran&#x27;s Mono Black Explorer list! #mtg Quoted Kyori58&#x27;s tweet: Been playing Mono Black in Explorer for the last few months &amp; this deck has never cease to let me down. Will write up a sideboard guide for the deck &amp; post it in this thread with a link. @fireshoes @mtgazone (Click photos to view full-size)
- [April 30, 2023, 2:04 p.m. The Mandalorian S3](https://roytang.net/2023/04/the-mandalorian-s3/): This was an okay season with some interesting cameos. The ending brought Bo-Katan and Moff Gideon&#x27;s story full circle and to a good conclusion and ending with Din Djarin and Grogu in a good spot for future adventures. I like how the subtitles still refer to Din Djarin as &quot;the Mandalorian&quot; even when there are like fifty other Mandalorians in the same scene. I&#x27;m not sure how much Pedro Pascal is earning his keep here. We never once see his face the entire season, so I&#x27;m wondering if he only gets VA rates?

Was underprepared and lost too much time brainstorming and struggling with Godot 4 and physics issues etc. All I have is throwing the pineapple: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9ElbNuGqZY Might be worth a blog post later. #ldjam
- [April 28, 2023, 2:08 p.m. Friday afternoon MTGMOM drafting](https://roytang.net/2023/04/9e7a844a48603ec5c429133eab420d1c/): https://twitch.tv/twitchyroy #twitch #mtgmom #mtg #magicarena [2023-04-30 14:31] These drafts did not go well, ending with 1 and 3 wins respectively. Sigh, I have yet to find my legs in this format. Skipping this weekend&#x27;s Arena Open because I feel so unprepared. Maybe Quick Drafts will be better?YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXUiNzQsfAk (Click photos to view full-size)
