- [Nov. 14, 2020, 5:36 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1327606340764766209/): Kaladesh Remastered draft ep 1 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld Sadly, internet wasn&#x27;t too good so I just cut the stream short. Too bad, so sad Draft didn&#x27;t feel super good, but I managed to break even in the games. No video because no stream. (In hindsight I could have just recorded locally!) Maybe I&#x27;ll try streaming a draft again early next week.
- [Nov. 12, 2020, 8:49 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1327111324728393728/): @amirrajan i dont have much other gamedev experience other than playing with unity a bit, but: I like that I can do most of the work in my text editor, and I like that it simplifies a lot of the work by making assumptions (like the 1280x720 resolution etc) so I can just focus on what I want
- [Nov. 12, 2020, 8:48 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1327110978798907392/): Decided to try a Kaladesh Remastered sealed before diving into draft. Didn&#x27;t do particularly well, but at least I got a feel of what the Kaladesh limited format is like (again) #mtg #magicarena #mtgkld
- [Nov. 12, 2020, 8:08 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1326919888472956928/): Past few days I&#x27;ve been playing around with this thing called Dragonruby Game Toolkit + some Kenney assets I got from the itch Racial Justice bundle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&amp;feature=youtu.be
