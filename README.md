- [Dec. 16, 2022, 2:22 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/twitch-recap/): This one is new, last year I had to add up these stats myself! I did around 50% more streams this year. I still don&#x27;t identify as a streamer though. And I still don&#x27;t watch a lot of other streams.
- [Dec. 16, 2022, 2:15 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/switch-year-in-review/): Four Switch games finished for me this year, which is a lot (assuming I actually manage to power through SMTV by end of year!) #NintendoSwitch2022 Previously
- [Dec. 16, 2022, 2:08 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/mtgbro-limited-7/): Did what might be final #MTGBRO drafts last night, this time with Alchemy! Unfortunately, this run ends on a poor note, as the two drafts went 0-3 and 3-3 respectively =/ YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wtxET01LUo Looking forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One next month, hopefully I do better with that set! #mtg #twitch #magicarena
