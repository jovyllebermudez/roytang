- [March 4, 2022, 11:37 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/03/hzbsdvk/): It&#x27;s even more annoying given that a good part of the world is still in a pandemic, and many would have been unable or unwilling to go out to theaters to watch in the first few days, and after that people just casually drop spoilers wherever. I was only able to watch No Way Home a couple of weeks ago because there was an Omicron surge in my country at the time it came out and I had no way to watch it safely.

A fun popcorn flick!
