- [Feb. 1, 2023, 12:30 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/02/training-day-2001/): An intense film, and summarizes neatly why I find it hard to trust law enforcement and any so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot;
- [Jan. 30, 2023, 1:47 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/3414422438460bb615ddfdd102e37807/): After we finished the first jigsaw puzzle a while back, Ma started working on the new one, which is roughly twice as large. We have been at this one for two weeks now!
- [Jan. 29, 2023, 4:32 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/109771562925638875/): @puzzletrailpaul pretty good! My anagram-loving friends enjoyed it! There seems to be a problem with Firefox though, the button for sharing results doesn&#x27;t appear (see screenshot). I only saw the buttonn when i tried it in edge (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Jan. 28, 2023, 9:49 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/109767149280055955/): @prijks I am surprised this format (with the content warning) works with the bot, I hadn&#x27;t handled it explicitly! Thanks for helping test!
- [Jan. 28, 2023, 9:36 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/the-menu-2022/): This was very, very good. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect; I thought it was going to be some stabby serial-killer thing, but the whole black comedy vibe and the rising tension were executed very well. Ralph Fiennes gives an excellent performance as the chef delivering the menu.
