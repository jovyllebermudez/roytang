- [April 16, 2021, 12:14 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1382910148306427907/): Friday afternoon Strixhaven sealed! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #MTGStrixhaven #twitch Ended up with a 3 hour stream doing 1 sealed and 1 draft. Didn&#x27;t finish too well, only went 4-3 in sealed with silverquill and 3-1 in draft with lorehold, but it&#x27;s a decent enough start. I like the set so far and looking forward to trying out the other houses! YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5kKeD3qj2Q&amp;feature=youtu.be

The Duterte govt gave us no choice. Those who still get vaccinated with sinovac should even be commended for setting aside their misgivings
- [April 16, 2021, 6:45 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1382827402338848769/): I got my #MagicArena stats for #mtgkhm! Pretty sure I was picking Priest of the Haunted Edge too highly. Also for some reason the last time I got one of these emails was for Theros Beyond Death one year ago. #MTGArenaStats
