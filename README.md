Hopefully the start of constant improvements!YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMRh9jUZczs (Click photos to view full-size)

- [May 1, 2023, 11:47 p.m. Gameday with Friends](https://roytang.net/2023/05/gameday/): Hung out with some friends today for card games and fighting games. We played two card games, Maskmen and Scout from OINKGames. They are both trick-taking card games (think Pusoy dos) with twists: Maskmen (flavored around Lucha Libre Wrestling): The order of cards (i.e. which cards can beat the others) are determined dynamically during the course of a game Scout (flavored around recruiting carnival people?): Each card consists of two numbers, one on each half of the card. The order of your hand is set (you cannot shuffle your hand!). Before the round begins, you must choose which half to
- [April 30, 2023, 4:17 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/04/1652587980337610752/): Managed to salvage Mythic rank for this #magicarena season on the last day using Chris Tran&#x27;s Mono Black Explorer list! #mtg Quoted Kyori58&#x27;s tweet: Been playing Mono Black in Explorer for the last few months &amp; this deck has never cease to let me down. Will write up a sideboard guide for the deck &amp; post it in this thread with a link. @fireshoes @mtgazone (Click photos to view full-size)
- [April 30, 2023, 2:04 p.m. The Mandalorian S3](https://roytang.net/2023/04/the-mandalorian-s3/): This was an okay season with some interesting cameos. The ending brought Bo-Katan and Moff Gideon&#x27;s story full circle and to a good conclusion and ending with Din Djarin and Grogu in a good spot for future adventures. I like how the subtitles still refer to Din Djarin as &quot;the Mandalorian&quot; even when there are like fifty other Mandalorians in the same scene. I&#x27;m not sure how much Pedro Pascal is earning his keep here. We never once see his face the entire season, so I&#x27;m wondering if he only gets VA rates?
