Latest notes:

- [June 24, 2023, 2:37 p.m. March of the Machine Arena Stats](https://roytang.net/2023/06/mtgmom-stats/): #MTGArenaStats email for #MTGMOM dropped. Last time I said I&#x27;d compile these into a table, but apparently I haven&#x27;t yet so here it is now: General Arena Stats. This table tells me MOM was a low-yield set for me; less games played and gold earned. Probably because I was drafting so poorly in this set. Or maybe I&#x27;ve just been playing less because I was busy.
- [June 24, 2023, 1:06 p.m. Movies: The Flash (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/06/the-flash-2023/): This review may contain spoilers. So, The Flash aka &quot;Miguel told you now to screw around with canon events!&quot; Maybe minor spoilers here.First off the controversial lead, but I won&#x27;t speak towards anything outside the film. Their performance was decent, especially considering most of the time they were their own scene partner.The Flash suit looks so weird and bulky especially when uncharged. I liked his plated suit from JL a lot more.Keaton&#x27;s older Bruce Wayne is the highlight of this film though. A manic and delightfully reckless performance. Sasha Calle does well as the very angry Supergirl, though her arc
- [June 23, 2023, 1:59 p.m. Popquiz: All Things Pride](https://roytang.net/2023/06/popquiz-pride/): It&#x27;s Pride month, so this event&#x27;s rounds were all themed around the word &quot;Pride&quot; Rounds were: LGBTQ Pride - 2pts Big and Small Cats in Media - 8pts Schools - 5pts Sins - 6pts (x2 due to powerup) Laundry and Soaps in Popular Media - 3pts Classic Romance Literature - 8pts (x2 due to successful Ace!) (Hail Mary) Drag Race Countries - 7pts The &quot;Hail Mary&quot; mechanic returned and we were eligible, so round 7 above replaced our lowest scoring round. We ended up tied for first place surprisingly, but the tiebreaker was a lipsync battle and we just conceded
- [June 20, 2023, 3:25 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/06/joqouya/): This reminds me that there&#x27;s this Zesto commercial from the 90s to the tune of Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Living on a Prayer&quot; that I&#x27;ve been looking for, baka merong may idea lol
- [June 19, 2023, 5:21 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/06/110570142528721074/): @jikodesu someone asled me if i had seen the latest season already and I was like &quot;Why? Is our current dystopia not enough?&quot;
