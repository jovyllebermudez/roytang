- [March 3, 2022, 1:37 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/03/drive/): Last night I wanted to watch a movie and settled on Drive (2011), mostly because of Carey Mulligan, who I really only knew from Blink. This film went from slow burn to sudden, graphic violence real quick. The protagonist hardly says anything. Very neo-noir. The director lingers on every shot, letting the audience soak up the mood. I feel like Ryan Gosling here is playing the same type of character he was in Blade Runner 2046, but I haven&#x27;t seen enough of his movies to know if that&#x27;s typical for his range. The film isn&#x27;t really about driving cars, although

Both of my quick drafts went poorly. I even had to play a bit of Historic with BG Food in order to afford the second one. That colossal sky turtle never came out to play!

- [March 1, 2022, 11:33 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/03/t3y7h9/): Posted on r/StreetFighter: SFV: Any way to export my fighter profile data? There&#x27;s a whole bunch of stats there in the fighter profile I&#x27;d like to be able to export to my PC (any parseable format is fine), likes win rates, per character usage rates, etc. Anyone know if there&#x27;s any way to extract or export that data? I have both PS4 and Steam accounts, so if possible I&#x27;d like to be able to export data for both profiles.
- [Feb. 27, 2022, 3:57 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/02/1497843283480879118/): Threw some gems away on the #mtgneo #MagicArena open this weekend. My sealed deck felt good, and I had the choice of 2 or 4 colors, but the odds were not in my favor. I was bummed so I did a quick draft afterwards which went much better! YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chW2WWph4i8 (Click photos to view full-size) [16:01] Doing poorly at an Arena Open is roughly the same level of feel bad as doing poorly at a GP, except at least I didn&#x27;t have to travel and spend a bunch of money (only gems) just to get trounced!
