- [Feb. 24, 2021, 6 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/02/lquag0/): Posted on r/StreetFighter: SF5 - is it expected to be so hard to find a match? Filthy casual here. I haven&#x27;t booted up the game in a while, I play on Steam (though I also have the PS4 copy... somewhere). Tried to find a match (ranked) last night, around 10pm. My settings are connection 4-5, platform any. Waited for 10 mins, couldn&#x27;t find a match. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m low ranked (ultra bronze i think) while everyone&#x27;s already silver and up or something? Or are there so few people playing nowadays that it&#x27;s difficult to find matches. Or

You queue up, you get paired, it chooses one of the decks in your collection at random (any format), you don&#x27;t know which until your mulligan decision. (People with &lt; 10 decks get starter decks added to their pool)
