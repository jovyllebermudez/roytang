- [28 Aug 2020 7:03am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g341dg1/): Very regular occurrence here in the Philippines unfortunately. After a presidential election, it’s not uncommon that most of the legislators jump ship to the president’s party (or their allies), presumably so they can partake of the spoils of the majority.
- [28 Aug 2020 4:55am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/g33ryjz/): Nah man, stores over here carry both R1 and R3 (sometimes R2)
- [27 Aug 2020 10:42am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1298933974887280645/): Thursday evening Amonkhet Remastered draft (ep11) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgakr #twitch

Well I guess we could just consider it. Also, it&rsquo;s not necessary to tag me directly, I check the bot&rsquo;s notifs every so often, so complaining directly to the bot should be fine.
