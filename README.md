- [Oct. 29, 2022, 2:34 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/inktober2022_29_30_31/): Still doing a single post for the last batch, will add the next entries one at a time. 29 - Uh-oh #inktober #inktober2022 #sketchdaily
- [Oct. 29, 2022, 2:21 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/doctor-who-2022/): Caught up with Jodie&#x27;s last 3 Doctor Who specials this week, since the internet already spoiled me about the thing at the end. Spoilers will be unmarked. Eve of the Daleks I should have enjoyed because I like time loops, but the execution here was a bit weird. They said in one of the earlier loops that they needed to save the guy because he was about to be killed and his death would be &quot;locked in&quot; for the next loop, which implies that they start each later loop with the &quot;one-minute&quot; state from the previous loops, but then later
