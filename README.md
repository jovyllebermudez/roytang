- [April 22, 2021, 2:34 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1385119677320335360/): There&#x27;s this guy in Hong Kong named Roy Tang who is &quot;Permanent Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs&quot;, which I suppose is some Beijing stooge. It&#x27;s annoying because he always shows up in my Google alerts lol
- [April 22, 2021, 2:31 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1385119158925361152/): 2 twitter accounts have blocked me! Lol I know one of those accounts, I wonder who the other is. This count is low compared to some of my mutuals, maybe I should get into more fights. Anyway, you can check your own stats here: https://blolook.osa-p.net/
- [April 22, 2021, 7:57 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/mvsss1/): Posted on r/GlobalTalk: [Question] What are the police like in your country?

- [April 22, 2021, 7:01 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1385005706646999044/): @wrongwaygoback I was wondering why I got that reply! IDK who this person is, thanks for the info. Reported and blocked.
