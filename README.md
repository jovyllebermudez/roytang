- [May 25, 2022, 12:35 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/ux9hkn/): Posted on r/Philippines: Around 800k votes was enough to get 2% in the party list elections. There are 859k members of r/Philippines. We should run a party-list in 2025. Reference: https://ph.rappler.com/elections/2022/races/party-list/results Actually, the threshold of votes needed should be quite a bit lower, since very few parties got 2%, so I believe they will proportionally parcel out slots to the lower ranked parties. If everyone on the sub voted for our party list (unlikely), we wouldn&#x27;t even have to campaign! Don&#x27;t ask me what our party-list agenda should be. But I believe marginalized sector naman ang r/PH redditors lol
- [May 23, 2022, 6:32 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/1528685311114592256/): Quick Drafting Streets of New Capenna! ep10 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgsnc #twitch [21:49] Two poor drafts again today to remind to stop trying to make Rakdos work no matter what cool mythics we get! Went 3-3 and 2-3 respectively. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C28DC93dqVY (Click photos to view full-size)
