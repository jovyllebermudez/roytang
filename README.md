Better luck next time? YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWCAkx9neSA (Click photos to view full-size)

Got some good rares, but sadly didn&#x27;t manage to get the 7th win (last opponent had Chandra and Manaform Hellkite lol) Will see if I can stream some drafts this weekend! #mtgcrimson

- [Nov. 12, 2021, 4:26 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/11/1459075159709519873/): Got my #mtgarenastats email for Midnight Hunt! I missed 3 weeks of play so I didn&#x27;t even complete the mastery, but 94 boosters opened is pretty good considering I had 120+ opened for KHM and STX #magicarena #mtgmidnight (Click photos to view full-size) [16:26] (and I didn&#x27;t get a stats email for AFR for some reason...) Also, this stats email didn&#x27;t give me the &quot;most drafted commons / uncommons&quot; stat, is it because I didn&#x27;t draft as much this time?
