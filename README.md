- [April 29, 2021, 12:18 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1387622193379430401/): @joshagarrado @talk2GLOBE Hi Josh! It&#x27;s you! Lol sorry, for some reason Twitter never gave me a notif for this. Apparently the bundle is part of the normal package I got when I signed up for my plan, except the first 24mo were free. So when the 24mo were up, they automatically charge me for it.
