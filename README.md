Our govt doesnt seem to understand that better things are possible.
Tagging @jacindaardern
Quoted cnnphilippines&#39;s tweet:   @daninakpil Año: &lsquo;yong mga countries na nag ze-zero (cases), either wala silang testing kit o nagsisinungaling sila.  
- [30 Jul 2020 10:25pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1288964042241929217/): @joyarmadamba I am surely not, but eegardless both of us are the wrong generation to affect these results. am also not convinced the typical/average genz pinoy even listens to the radio
- [30 Jul 2020 10:01pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1288957903735422976/): @joyarmadamba (1) his data is global (I participated), although it is reasonable to assume majority of respondents are americans/europeans. (2) &ldquo;constant radio airplay&rdquo; -&gt; not sure if true, I&rsquo;ve certainly never heard &ldquo;Stay&rdquo; on the radio in the last 10 years.
@joyarmadamba This may just be an observation bias on your part since you likely prefer listening to radio stations that specialize in &ldquo;oldies&rdquo; (and those radio stations exist in other countries too)
- [30 Jul 2020 5:47pm](https://roytang.net/2020/07/1288893973776306177/): I cant recommend this improv special enough (its on netflix). Already seen it but rewatching the clips is still funny
Quoted rejectedjokes&#39;s tweet:   This Fucking Guy. #MiddleditchAndSchwartz
