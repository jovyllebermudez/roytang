- [Dec. 1, 2020, 8:42 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1333994890338832384/): It&#x27;s only the 1st week of December and we&#x27;re already getting &quot;best of 2020&quot; lists. The year isn&#x27;t up yet, who knows what surprises await!
- [Nov. 30, 2020, 5:48 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1333407638336532480/): Streaming some Kaladesh Remastered draft! Watch me be terrible https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld As predicted; I was indeed terrible. Draft seemed to go well enough, but I made too many mistakes I guess? Seems like this format is not for me. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S15AgtyStzw
