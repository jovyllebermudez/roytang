- [April 16, 2023, 5:52 p.m. Movies: Surrogates (2009)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/surrogates-2009/): I remember seeing the trailer for this one back in the day and thought it might be interesting. I was wrong. There was one decent action sequence in there but the rest of the film was forgettable.I also have trouble with the idea that the use of surrogates is so widespread that homicides are unheard of, yet there are these large anti-surrogate reservations right next to the big cities where the residents all look like homeless people. Also surely only middle class and up are able to afford surrogates, so does the rest of society just live in these dread

- [April 13, 2023, 8:47 p.m. Movies: Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-2023/): This was so good. Fresh, fun and witty adventure, and so many references for those familiar with the source material. I liked the Paladin and the Druid, but all the characters are quite good and reasonably fleshed out and likeable and the performances are pretty good. This is what I wish MCU movies could be like since Endgame.
