Second sealed deck was kind of a mess, but still managed to get to 5-3. Set seems fun, looking forward to drafting! (Click photos to view full-size)

That Team usually seems chill though, maybe it wasn&#x27;t really a serious comment? For the record, I think your hosting at quiz nights was pretty good!
