- [May 6, 2023, 1:38 p.m. Movies: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-2023/): Feels like this had a darker, more somber and much more emotional tone than the first two films. A very hateable villain, especially for animal lovers. The Guardians crew are at the best they&#x27;ve ever been; the banter and the coordination fighting alongside each other are a testament of how they&#x27;ve grown together as a found family. The films gives a fitting end to the story arcs for most of our Guardians crew.Some plot nitpicks here and there, and my brother though the film was just a tad too long, but nothing too problematic. James Gunn has more or less

Unfortunately we only went 1 and 4 still, a step back from the day 4 record. Winning in this format continues to elude me. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOzi3USXzeg

We did much better than I expected despite having only 3 people who actually knew Star Wars stuff Rounds were: Prequel trilogy - 6pts Animated TV - 7pts Original trilogy - 7pts (x2 for powerup) Live Action TV - 7pts Sequel Trilogy - 6pts Star Wars References in other media - 5pts The &quot;Hail Mary&quot; mechanic returned; this time we were eligible, but we also knew nothing about the question so we opted not to answer and just live with our lowest round score of 5pts. Still not a fan of

Hopefully the start of constant improvements!YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMRh9jUZczs (Click photos to view full-size)
