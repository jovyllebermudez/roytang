- [Jan. 11, 2021, 10:53 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1348644221733883905/): Has this &quot;government&quot; actually made any comment on the price difference as compared to other vaccines? Quoted cnnphilippines&#x27;s tweet: Roque on govt&#x27;s suppposed preference for Sinovac: Yun ang vaccine na una nating nakuha, at ang Western brands, na lantad ang colonial mentality sa mga Pilipino, July pa natin makukuha earliest
- [Jan. 11, 2021, 9:52 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1348628918979358722/): Timezones are terrible.
- [Jan. 11, 2021, 9:39 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1348625596683673604/): Some kind of cat in a tree #sketchdaily 11/365
- [Jan. 11, 2021, 3:10 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/giuoap8/): That seems to be for a text link?
- [Jan. 10, 2021, 11:09 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1348225436602437636/): Over 40. I think yes, even in the 90s. I do remember hearing about things like Saddam invading Kuwait, fall of the Soviet Union, Desert Storm, etc. The main difference for me today is that we get a lot more &quot;internal to the US&quot; news, or maybe that&#x27;s just the sources I follow. Quoted itxaropena&#x27;s tweet: Over 30s of Twitter, Was your teenage life surrounded with many world events? Was the world this crazy back then?
