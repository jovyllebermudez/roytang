- [Nov. 21, 2022, 4:39 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/1594430240691847168/): Thoughts on Twitter, Musk, and the destruction of the virtual public square. The end may be near. No amount of snark or schadenfreude will change the fact that this situation is a disaster. Twitter has always been a mess – but also a crucial instrument to democratize America. There are two distinct, but intertwined issues here: There is the fact that a tech oligarchy, animated by an inherently anti-democratic worldview, holds so much power; and there is, more specifically, the threat to the world’s most important political communications platform.

- [Nov. 19, 2022, 6:08 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/11/1593909027477803008/): OMG, after so many attempts, I qualified for an @EternalCardGame open day 2 for the first time! Looking forward to tomorrow! (Click photos to view full-size)
