- [May 21, 2023, 1:22 p.m. More MOM drafting](https://roytang.net/2023/05/momdrafts/): I&#x27;m not streaming March of the Machine drafts anymore, but I did do some drafting online this past week, in prep for potentially playing in this weekend&#x27;s Arena Open. (Spoiler: I did not end up playing the open.) First up, I actually tried drafting on MTGO! It has been a long while - in fact I have no idea when I last played a game on MTGO, though I do login to check the account occasionally. When I checked my account, I saw that I actually had enough play points to enter a draft league, which I had never done
- [May 18, 2023, 11:53 p.m. Popquiz: Some Like It Hot](https://roytang.net/2023/05/popquiz-hot/): This was a difficult and low-scoring quiz night at one of the usual haunts. Despite a couple of terrible rounds and a poor choice of joker, we actually managed to finish 1pt away from tying for first! Scores for this game were super close, as is typical with difficult, wide-open nights. Rounds were: Hot Food - 2pts Hot Places - 5pts (x2 for powerup)* Hot People (reality/dating shows) - 4pts Heated Arguments (feuds and rivalries) - 2pts Billboard Hot 100 (bad google translated song lyrics) - 7pts (x2 for successful Ace!) Steamy Scenes - 5pts (Hail Mary) OG Viva Hot
- [May 15, 2023, 1:18 p.m. Movies: Police Story 3: Super Cop (1992)](https://roytang.net/2023/05/police-story-3-super-cop-1992/): Watched this only because I heard young Michelle Yeoh was in it, then realized afterwards that I&#x27;ve never actually seen Police Story 2.It was fine, lots of good fighting and stunts as would be expected. Michelle Yeoh looks so different especially during the earlier scenes; I think if I had seen this blind it might have taken me a while to recognize her. She did great though.I think I like the original Police Story a bit more; like the bus sequences in the third act of the first film were a bit more interesting than the train sequences here. Though
