- [April 22, 2023, 9:17 p.m. Star Trek Picard S3](https://roytang.net/2023/04/picard-s3/): This is the final season for Star Trek: Picard and hopefully the last great adventure for Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, we all know he has earned a rest! I liked this season, probably more than seasons 1 or 2, mainly because I was a big fan of TNG - I watched a bit of it back in the 90s but was only able to binge all of it around 2015 I think. This season reunites Admiral Picard with his old crew as they discover a Secret Invasion-style conspiracy within Starfleet that leads them to face off against one of Picard&#x27;s greatest
- [April 22, 2023, 8:41 p.m. Arkham Horror LCG](https://roytang.net/2023/04/arkham-horror-lcg/): Played Arkham Horror LCG at a friend&#x27;s house yesterday. It&#x27;s a coop card game of solving mysteries based on the Cthulhu mythos. We did two scenarios, the first one is The Gathering from the core game which was the intro, and the second one was Curtain Call from the Path to Carcosa. The two scenarios took us around 5hrs of playtime total I think, with a break in between for dinner. We made it through Curtain Call with only one person dying and being traumatized! We&#x27;ll see if we have time to do another session of these and continue the

- [April 22, 2023, 2:33 p.m. Movies: The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2023/): Pretty good as far as video game adaptations go. The plot of the film is definitely for kids, but that can&#x27;t be avoided as the source material isn&#x27;t exactly deep. A fun romp with lots of references for fans of the Mario franchise in general. Huge improvement over the last film!+ performances by Jack Black and Seth Rogen who were obviously having fun+ Charles Martinet (original Mario voice) playing Mario&#x27;s dad!!+ Peach kicking ass+ the existential Luma lol- not explaining if their last name is Mario
