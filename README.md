Latest notes:

- [June 24, 2023, 1:06 p.m. Movies: The Flash (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/06/the-flash-2023/): This review may contain spoilers. So, The Flash aka &quot;Miguel told you now to screw around with canon events!&quot; Maybe minor spoilers here.First off the controversial lead, but I won&#x27;t speak towards anything outside the film. Their performance was decent, especially considering most of the time they were their own scene partner.The Flash suit looks so weird and bulky especially when uncharged. I liked his plated suit from JL a lot more.Keaton&#x27;s older Bruce Wayne is the highlight of this film though. A manic and delightfully reckless performance. Sasha Calle does well as the very angry Supergirl, though her arc
- [June 20, 2023, 3:25 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/06/joqouya/): This reminds me that there&#x27;s this Zesto commercial from the 90s to the tune of Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Living on a Prayer&quot; that I&#x27;ve been looking for, baka merong may idea lol
- [June 19, 2023, 5:21 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/06/110570142528721074/): @jikodesu someone asled me if i had seen the latest season already and I was like &quot;Why? Is our current dystopia not enough?&quot;
- [June 11, 2023, 7:37 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/06/110525378489097432/): Huh, the indieweb,.social web UI has changed. How can I move this posting form back to the leftmost column?
- [June 6, 2023, 11:41 p.m. Movies: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/06/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-2023/): A fantastic follow-up to the original 2018 movie, further developing Miles and expanding on Gwen&#x27;s back story as well. Fantastic use of animation not only to portray the different universes, but as also as a storytelling tool to convey emotion, tone and depth. Also I must commend the marketing for preparing trailers that while they showed a lot of the fun stuff in the films, never spoiled any of the deeper plot moments or the cause of the ultimate conflict that arises between Miles and the other Spiders. Looking forward to Beyond the Spider-verse next year!
