So I checked and saw I could still book a slot for 3PM at SM North and I was like why not, if it&#x27;s only 20 minutes? FAM I WAS THERE FOR 3.5 HOURS THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE. I forgot that today was the last day of the National Vaccination drive or whatever it&#x27;s called. Rewarded myself afterwards with some Pepper Lunch, first time back at a mall since March 2020!
