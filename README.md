- [7 Aug 2020 5:04am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1291601175020597248/): @wrongwaygoback I had to lookup the video of how Trump said Thailand. I feel like he&rsquo;s not too far off from how I say it. There&rsquo;s a lot of things to criticize him about, but this one seems meh. The Yosemite thing was much worse
- [6 Aug 2020 11:19am](https://roytang.net/2020/08/1291332988135931904/): Streaming some Magic Arena Historic with Jund Sacrifice https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy

- [4 Aug 2020 8:22pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/438c67100e2f5d99412ecb63e6eb9bca/): I&rsquo;m testing something.
Ignore this post.
Or don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not your mother.
- [4 Aug 2020 8:15pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/4aab780a936cbcca72d043f98cdd53ec/): Between Jumpstart in mid-July, Amonkhet Remastered in mid-August, and Zendikar Rising in mid-Sept, MTG Arena is seriously challenging my F2P-ness. (Pretty sure that&rsquo;s what they intended!)
- [4 Aug 2020 8:14pm](https://roytang.net/2020/08/a7e178343be582801775b6ee89e7a6b3/): Unnecessarily re-installed xcode today because Stackoverflow had an old accepted answer that involved a reinstall; the actual useful answer was more recent (4 years newer) and only required settings updates. SO needs a way for people to mark newer answers as more relevant.
