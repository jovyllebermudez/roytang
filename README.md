- [May 15, 2022, 9:37 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/1525832723218083840/): If you have less tech-savvy older relatives who are victims of the regime&#x27;s disinformation machine: Acquire their YT/FB login/password (create an excuse, borrow their phone and reset the password or create a new account) Login to the YT/FB account on another device. [21:38] 3. Watch/like anti-fake news videos, mainstream media videos and block fake news pages/channels using their account. Repeat often. Occasionally bring up talking points to see if their views are changing.
- [May 15, 2022, 6:01 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/05/1525778275066589184/): This is the kind of thing I want to see. Not just one show, but as many as possible, oversaturating the internet even.

(All of this requires time, money, effort) Quoted RegineCabato&#x27;s tweet: Yes, the attempt to dumb down the conversation re: NGO definition is a troll line. Proposal: A fun and snappy weekly YouTube show called TrollBusters compiling and debunking the scripts of the week, gathering screen caps and receipts, explaining the structures, fallacies, etc. https://twitter.com/imnotyomom/status/1525381997836632064
