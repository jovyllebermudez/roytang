- [Oct. 24, 2020, 12:15 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/10/1319794495395745793/): Despite not having played Eternal since before the pandemic, after reading this tweet from LSV, I signed up for the event he described and got the 7 wins and qualified for the LCQ in the first try. I used Skelle&#x27;s decklist from here: https://direwolfdigital.com/news/throne-summer-championship-decklists/ I&#x27;m having fun! Quoted lsv&#x27;s tweet: This is the perfect time to get into Eternal - you can try any deck you want, you&#x27;ve got a high-stakes tournament to play in, and there are lots of resources in the article for decklists, strategy guides, and more. I&#x27;m really hype about this, and would love to see
