- [March 23, 2021, 3:39 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/03/1374264516414894085/): Whenever I deliver any software to clients I should go “Please enjoy the gifts from me, please make a commitment that you will take care of this code, you will take car of this database, you will take care of these bugs..” Quoted paulcatiang&#x27;s tweet: Managed to get the receipt for the crass display by @DOTrPH. Remember, the people&#x27;s taxes paid for those and continue to put food on your tables, you ungrateful public servants. By the way, we&#x27;ve lost so many hours in traffic thanks to your incompetence. Umayos nga kayo.
