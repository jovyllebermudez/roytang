- [March 11, 2021, 7:29 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/03/1369973843050164226/): A bit worse off, since we didn&#x27;t have a pandemic in 1985 afaik. Quoted LaTtEX&#x27;s tweet: Massacres openly conducted by the police and military. Opposition figures in jail. A dying but belligerent despot. Deputies jockeying for power. A crashed economy. Infrastructure projects burying us in decades of debt. Aminin na natin Pilipinas, bumalik lang tayo sa 1985.

- [March 10, 2021, 9:20 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/03/gqfxqv1/): They should release the 3 Kaldra equipment into historic one at a time, one every three years or so
