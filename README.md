- [Oct. 26, 2022, 1:29 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/catch-me/): Watched Catch Me If You Can last night. Actually over two nights. Been meaning to see this for a while, it looked neat. Frank Abagnale&#x27;s capers are largely entertaining, though the narration does feel heavily exaggerated in favor of the protagonist (and reading through Abagnale&#x27;s wikipedia entry suggests so as well). DiCaprio and Hanks give great performances here and I really enjoyed how they spoke every Christmas became friends by the end.

- [Oct. 23, 2022, 8:30 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/black-adam/): Enjoyed Black Adam, despite the poor critic reviews. The plot isn&#x27;t anything spectacular, but it&#x27;s a fun romp and good for comic fans. Was very happy to be correct that the actress playing Adrianna was Shaw from Person of Interest! She should have gotten higher billing. Brosnan gave a great performance as Fate. The VFX guys really loved Cyclone. Atom Smasher probably my favorite of the JSA crew. The Rock maximizing the use of his one &quot;smoldering&quot; look. Viola Davis, Jennifer Holland, Djimon Hounsou, and [surprise mid-credits actor cameo] reprising roles were welcome surprises. The only character I didn&#x27;t actually
- [Oct. 23, 2022, 4 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/seda/): 
- [Oct. 23, 2022, 12:01 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/10/bullet-train/): Watched Bullet Train tonight. Was quite entertaining. I came in not knowing anything that wasn&#x27;t in the very first trailer. A colorful action film with some fun twists and surprising cameos. I really liked the soundtrack too, especially Japanese song covers.
