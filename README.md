- [Dec. 28, 2022, 7:13 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/4795d020d965b07c782e42ce88e0d717/): As expected, problems plague first hours of SIM registration - https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/12/27/2233582/expected-problems-plague-first-hours-sim-registration No one is surprised. Also, I don&#x27;t understand why so many people are excited to comply with the registration, it&#x27;s not like it benefits you personally or directly. If I had to register, it would be at the last possible moment.
- [Dec. 27, 2022, 11:26 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2022/12/letterboxd-review-329402655/): An ok whodunnit with 1.5 likeable leads, though trying to compare itself to Agathe Christie is a bad idea as the mystery here is nowhere near as clever. This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen Saoirse Ronan in anything.
