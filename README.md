- [Nov. 12, 2021, 4:26 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/11/1459075159709519873/): Got my #mtgarenastats email for Midnight Hunt! I missed 3 weeks of play so I didn&#x27;t even complete the mastery, but 94 boosters opened is pretty good considering I had 120+ opened for KHM and STX #magicarena #mtgmidnight (Click photos to view full-size) [16:26] (and I didn&#x27;t get a stats email for AFR for some reason...) Also, this stats email didn&#x27;t give me the &quot;most drafted commons / uncommons&quot; stat, is it because I didn&#x27;t draft as much this time?

Was not disappointed. Fantastic visual design and cinematography. Lots of familiar actors showed up! Harrison Ford only appeared halfway through. I liked the reveal of how what the movie was telegraphing all along was a fake. [2021-11-11 09:31] I actually don&#x27;t remember when I watched the original (probably only within the past 10y or so; I never saw it during the time it came out) and don&#x27;t recall most of the plot, but I feel like this one was much
