- [July 15, 2021, 11:27 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/07/1415513241527021574/): I am often asked if I will “return to cryptocurrency” or begin regularly sharing my thoughts on the topic again.

Internet was a bit problematic though, so the video upload is probably choppy. YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXr2WUiQQcQ
