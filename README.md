Connery&#x27;s hair starting to go a bit gray in his last appearance. More Blofeld than I&#x27;d expected (harhar). Space laser! Plenty O&#x27;Toole seemed pointless, there just to die. A lot of cheesy lines from the assassin henchment. These movies would be a lot shorter if they just shot Bond whenever they caught him. The action scenes in all these old Bond films always feel so jarring compared to modern ones. Limited by the technology of their time I guess.

A win-win for mobsters and the pump-and-dumpers behind this. As usual, the people will loose, and they lost my trust. https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1379763470216888321
