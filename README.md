I even thought both decks looked decent! Let&#x27;s hope we do better next time!YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv2-HagfZ5k (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Feb. 19, 2023, 8:29 a.m. Movies: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/02/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-2023/): Watched this yesterday. Spoiler-free review: I enjoyed the film, but that might be because I&#x27;m a comics fan anyway and I don&#x27;t care too much about CGI detail (a lot of people seem hung up on that). I liked the humor and the references, I liked the bad guy&#x27;s costume design, was pleasantly surprised by some actors&#x27; being there and was honestly a bit giddy when a certain acronym was first mentioned. That being said, I can understand all the complaints about the film. Character development is definitely not great and some of the returning cast don&#x27;t have a lot

Apparently $44B tech companies are unable to automatically turn off a feature they are planning to take away!
