- [Jan. 2, 2021, 2:58 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/01/1345504732060663808/): PSA: if you keep your timeline in &quot;latest tweets&quot; mode (click sparkly blue icon on top right of app) you will have a chronological timeline and never have to see what your follows like. I always forget that&#x27;s a thing since I never see it Quoted daretorant&#x27;s tweet: I feel like folks don’t fully realize that liking a tweet puts it into their followers’ feeds (almost at the same rate that RTs do). When I see a tweet because “X liked this”, I am now re-evaluating whether I should follow them because of their “like curations”
