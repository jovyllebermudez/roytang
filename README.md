- [June 2, 2021, 4:44 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/cbb6135fa20b48a488982eccc7df76ce/): Watched Moonraker (1979). Spectacular opening sequence. Villain reminds me of Tyrion Lannister. California -&gt; Venice -&gt; Rio de Janeiro. Mandatory canal chase while in Venice, obviously. Lots of of product placement. A bad guy tried to ambush 007 with a KENDO STICK. Have they heard of guns? Comically indestructible assassin Jaws appears again, and actually has a character arc this time. First half of the movie was kind of meh, but the last third of the film with the space station and the laser battles and the ridiculous villain plan kind of won me over with how campy it all
- [June 1, 2021, 10:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1399732348095135749/): Storefront #sketchdaily for May 30 (still a lot behind!) 149/365
- [June 1, 2021, 7:47 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/06/1399693989582835713/): Cops should just be banned from drinking while carrying weapons. Or from drinking altogether maybe. Either way is fine. (Enforcement would be tough) Quoted manilabulletin&#x27;s tweet: LOOK: A police officer lies dead after a fellow police shot him when the latter ‚Äúlost in an arm wrestling‚Äù during a drinking session in Quezon City, police bared Tuesday, citing narrative of a witness.
