- [July 13, 2023, 5:51 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/07/110703324373892329/): Sadly a no internet morning for me as #globe fiber has been down since midnight. Already reported, lets see how good their response time is. Also yesterday we lost electricity for most of the morning so the week is going great lol
- [July 12, 2023, 9:39 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/07/110701390914256286/): I wasn&#x27;t able to take a screenshot, but letterboxd has a cool little easter egg if you submit a review for Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, took me by surprise! #movies
- [July 12, 2023, 9:38 p.m. Movies: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/07/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-2023/): Each Mission Impossible seems to have a signature stunt/scene to remember it by, like the hanging from the ceiling bit in the first film or climbing the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol. This one for sure will be remembered by the bike jump off the cliff; it&#x27;s only too bad it was heavily promoted in trailers and previews, so there is little to no surprise when he actually does it in the film.I liked the set pieces in Rome and the final train sequence (though it reminds me of a certain Playstation game.) Venice felt weak. The rest was okay.Decent
- [July 6, 2023, 11:48 p.m. Vault and Corona Presents 90s PopQuiz](https://roytang.net/2023/07/popquiz-90s/): This was a new venue for the 90s-themed PQ, and as 90s kids we were kind of obliged to go. Rounds were: 90s movies - 8pts x2 for power-up 90s live action TV - 6pts 90s animated TV/movies - 6pts 90s events/personalities/games - 9pts 90s opm - 7pts x2 for ace 90s throwback - 6pts No &quot;Hail Mary&quot; for us this time. (Honestly the venue food is kind of pricy, not sure I&#x27;d eat there again.) We did relatively, ending up in 2nd place; the winning team had really good joker and ace rounds, so we wouldn&#x27;t have won even
- [July 5, 2023, 11:38 p.m. Geekfight Fandom Fiesta](https://roytang.net/2023/07/geekfight-fandom/): We attended Geekfight @ Hobby Stadium again last night. I felt confident about two of the categories, but I did poorly. Rounds were: Isekai - 3pts Barbie - 7pts America - 7pts BTS - 4pts Street Fighter - 4pts, x2 for joker. I was confident in my stock knowledge here so I jokered, but apparently they knew my weaknesses: remembering move names and character theme music! Lord of the Rings - 1pt. Lol I even prepped for this one by watching Rings of Power and rewatching the original trilogy, but I was still unprepared for all the deep cuts. We
