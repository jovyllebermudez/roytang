- [Dec. 30, 2020, 10:50 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344355074722578433/): Apparently I was suspected of being a robot.
- [Dec. 30, 2020, 5:11 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344269903285473283/): I thought my PC had died earlier today, but I was somehow able to resurrect it. Here&#x27;s hoping this machine outlasts the pandemic somehow
- [Dec. 30, 2020, 5:10 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344269606374948865/): @joyarmadamba uh, might be through less than legal means. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s &quot;justified&quot; wut. ... let&#x27;s not have this convo everytime i watch sth not available to stream locally, medyo madami for 2021 lol
- [Dec. 29, 2020, 11:58 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/12/1344191049963425795/): Finally watched #WonderWoman1984. Maybe don&#x27;t think too much about what&#x27;s going on in the movie. My headcanon is that the only reason it takes place in 1984 is because it&#x27;s pre-crisis
