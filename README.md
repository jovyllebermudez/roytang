Latest notes:

- [Jan. 19, 2023, 12:56 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/10fcbbx/): Posted on r/MarvelUnlimited: Does is anyone know why Captain America #400 is incomplete on MU? It only has the main story from operation galatic storm. Looks like there should also be backups with falcon and usagent rescuing dman and diamondback/crossbones origin story
- [Jan. 17, 2023, 9:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/109704744130699285/): @jikodesu do you need to have the DDG app as the default browser to use this?
- [Jan. 16, 2023, 7:57 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/1614954978602520576/): @Westraid Happy birthday!
- [Jan. 16, 2023, 5:09 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/1614912728325578752/): I have unfollowed 95% of my Twitter follows. Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m probably still following you via a list. My DMs are no longer open. They&#x27;re only ever crypto spam bots nowadays anyway. My website will always tell you how to contact me: https://roytang.net/page/about/contact/ [17:09] I probably post there more anyway: https://roytang.net/all/ Like and subscribe: https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy, https://www.youtube.com/@roytang Triviabot: @triviabot and https://botsin.space/@triviastorm
- [Jan. 14, 2023, 11:44 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2023/01/letterboxd-review-339378547/): I like this new CGI animation style, everything looks cool. The plot is pretty by the numbers for a DC thing, but the banter between the boys is great.
