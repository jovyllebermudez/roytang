- [April 12, 2021, 3:28 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/04/1381509474259673090/): Needed something light to watch in the background, so I watched Airplane! (1980). It&#x27;s the kind of movie where they just stuff in as many gags as possible, every throwaway line and even stuff happening in the background is a gag.
