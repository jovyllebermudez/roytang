- [Aug. 7, 2021, 7:59 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/08/1423796016222937090/): After last night&#x27;s terrible W/L record in the final #mtgafr draft stream, I decided to do an off-stream quick draft just so I hit platinum by Aug 10. Naturally this was the one where I managed to get 7 wins lol
- [Aug. 6, 2021, 6:36 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/08/1423593848127770630/): Drafting Adventures in the Forgotten Realms! final (?) episode https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtgafr #magicarena #twitch [22:42] Tonight&#x27;s extra long final AFR stream featured FOUR DRAFTS. Look at these piles and try to guess whether I made it out of Gold rank? YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B7kTTuQGgM
- [Aug. 6, 2021, 6:27 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/08/12cbfc5fe2bf124a832da481095c364b/): THE SUICIDE SQUAD spoiler-free review: great, fun, violent, hilarious, possibly best of DCEU so far trailers have spoiled waaaay too much of this movie first act was ok, second act felt a bit meh, third act was great hard to comment on actor performances without spoiling things, but Daniela Melchior was great and Idris Elba took the role seriously there is a post-credits scene Full review on the blog later
