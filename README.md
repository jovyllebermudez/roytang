- [March 24, 2023, 5:17 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/03/1639013551343026176/): Ugh, did they roll out a new version of Tweetdeck? Not only do I dislike this change, I&#x27;m worried about EM being aware of Tweetdeck lol
- [March 23, 2023, 1:44 p.m. Arena Mythic March 2023](https://roytang.net/2023/03/c570a3599955dc065f47de15cb5e9b1c/): Managed to hit Mythic in #MagicArena after a long drought (last time was way back in August!), right before I leave town and need to be away from Arena for a few days I was running Esper Legends in Standard, it&#x27;s a fun deck! And current Standard is actually a bit fun, despite the prevalence of Fable

- [March 20, 2023, 1:04 p.m. Junk Shop](https://roytang.net/2023/03/junk-shop/): I&#x27;m always amused by this sign whenever I walk past this storefront. (Name translates loosely to &quot;Buying circuit breaker junk shop&quot;)
