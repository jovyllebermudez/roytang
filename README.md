- [17 Sep 2020 8:27pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306691161415847936/): @TheZvi Maintenance has been extended. https://magicthegatheringarena.statuspage.io/ Probably better to wait for a while than trying stuff again
- [17 Sep 2020 5:45pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/1306650526990376960/): Zendikar Rising draft! ep1 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgzkn

- [17 Sep 2020 5:08pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/g5lsqjn/): I got a bunch of Zendikar cards already (not sure if I also retained the stuff I got from the buggy renewal gift earlier)
- [16 Sep 2020 6:23pm](https://roytang.net/2020/09/04b1428fe35c94f8157dc2178209b6a7/): I&rsquo;ve been using git for at least 6 years, and every time I need to do a merge I still search for &ldquo;git merging&rdquo; to make sure I don&rsquo;t merge in the wrong direction
