- [April 22, 2023, 2:33 p.m. Movies: The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2023/): Pretty good as far as video game adaptations go. The plot of the film is definitely for kids, but that can&#x27;t be avoided as the source material isn&#x27;t exactly deep. A fun romp with lots of references for fans of the Mario franchise in general. Huge improvement over the last film!+ performances by Jack Black and Seth Rogen who were obviously having fun+ Charles Martinet (original Mario voice) playing Mario&#x27;s dad!!+ Peach kicking ass+ the existential Luma lol- not explaining if their last name is Mario

- [April 19, 2023, 4:43 p.m. Current Status](https://roytang.net/2023/04/current-status/): Wandering through life finding interesting things. Semi-retired (but sometimes I say I&#x27;m &quot;freelancing&quot;, it&#x27;s easier for people to understand.)
