- [Feb. 5, 2023, 1:53 p.m. Movies: Daredevil (2003)](https://roytang.net/2023/02/daredevil-2003/): Starting on my backlog of poorly-reviewed comic book moviesThis one I think tried to cram in way too many elements of the Daredevil mythos into one film. Trying to do Elektra, Kingpin and Bullseye all in one go was maybe a bit too ambitious. It led to them cutting back on actually developing each character properly. No mention of Stick or the Hand anywhere, we are just supposed to believe that Matt gained his fighting skills just by training a lot as by himself a kid. And Matt is super cavalier with not hiding his extra senses! He randomly tries

- [Feb. 4, 2023, 12:49 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/02/1621551404916801537/): The trivia team and I have collectively been working through the Acrostic backlog (via Discord streams), and we are only up to mid-2009, not enough time to finish everything before Mar 1 I maybe understand not publishing new ones, but getting rid of the archive makes no sense! Quoted NYTGames&#x27;s tweet: ðŸ”” Starting at noon March 1st, we will no longer publish digital Variety and Acrostic puzzles. To learn more visit our Help Center: https://trib.al/0zp8O83. You can continue to play these puzzles in print: https://trib.al/JZi38Tn
- [Feb. 3, 2023, 1:12 a.m. Superstore S6](https://roytang.net/2023/02/superstore-s6/): This series came out on NF recently and I was reminded that I never watched the final season so I binged that in the background over a couple of days. Season is relatively short (15 eps) and I guess generally of the same quality as the previous ones. Mostly watched this one just to get some closure. A few laughs here and there, most plotlines resolved satisfactorily. The best thing about this show was the relatively large ensemble cast (since a big box store requires a lot of staff), so they rarely run out of B-plots to run.
