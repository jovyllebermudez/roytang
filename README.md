- [May 17, 2021, 1:33 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/05/c72ceb2e3748ccd8611baab1cbfdfe74/): I finished reading What Matters Now by Seth Godin, a book that is basically a collection of short blog posts by &quot;big thinkers&quot;, released for free back in 2009. Interestingly, a lot of the ideas presented in the book still feel relevant today. I didn&#x27;t think it needed a full review post. The funniest part for me is that one of the entries is by Jason Fried about how to apologize, advice he certainly could have used during the recent Bandcamp brouhaha You can get a copy here
