- [Dec. 20, 2021, 10:16 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/1472933987718815750/): It took me SIX ATTEMPTS to get my first #MagicArena Decathlon token in the MID+VOW sealed event. Not sure I want to bother with the Alchemy one (Click photos to view full-size) [2021-12-21 13:43] I tried the Alchemy event anyway and got there in one run! So much for being better at Limited than Constructed lol. I ran Monoblack blood. One more token to qualify for the finals! I guess this is the #MagicArena decathlon thread now.

- [Dec. 20, 2021, 4:19 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/1472844199091642369/): Thread about NFTs and property Quoted beka_valentine&#x27;s tweet: NFTs are a massive scam but they are also a beautiful anthropological device that demonstrates the fact that private property is, and has always been, a social construct
- [Dec. 19, 2021, 9:24 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2021/12/c65caaf1deb0e34faaddb3451ac0cdd8/): I have a bit of face blindness when it comes to Pacino and De Niro, I always need a second to figure out which is which when they&#x27;re together. Great perfromances here and it&#x27;s a pretty good crime film, with a lot of big names (very young Natalie Portman!)
