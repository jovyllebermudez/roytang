- [Nov. 29, 2020, 4:06 p.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1333200765167366144/): Last minute mythic on #magicarena. Also hit master on Eternal last week, so it&#x27;s my first double month! #mtg
- [Nov. 26, 2020, 5:46 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/10e889f1bfa7c8798065f6dcfe8b2278/): I wonder if any other Django devs always forgot what their local env&#x27;s superuser password is and just createsuperuser again every so often
- [Nov. 23, 2020, 5:09 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1330861073247813634/): @art_abon Ranma has a much bigger cast that can cause hijinx. Dito it&#x27;s always either Larry or Balki (and Larry most of the time)
- [Nov. 23, 2020, 5:08 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1330860801477885960/): @joyarmadamba uh, i have a copy
- [Nov. 21, 2020, 3:40 a.m.](https://roytang.net/2020/11/1330113747550134277/): I&#x27;ve been binging Perfect Strangers. Fun show (and maybe best theme song), but 80% of the eps are like &quot;Balki says/does something naive, Larry overreacts and gets them into trouble, but it all works out in the end&quot;
